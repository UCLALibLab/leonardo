"10.2307/1571866","Sculpture and the Principle of Bipolarity","Martin Blaszko","Leonardo",1,"3",1968-07-01,"pp. 223-232","10.2307/1571866","The MIT Press","fla","","Every artist has a personal need of expression, and, after some time, his work takes on a character that satisfies this need. The author finds that sculptural structures based on the principle of bipolarity provide him with such a personal form of expression. The term bipolarity refers to a structure having two diametrically opposed characteristics or natures. In each new work the artist states that he struggles with antagonistic forces, which obsess him until a motif crystallizes to give him a sense of liberation and of aesthetic satisfaction. He arranges his structural composition in such a way that the eyes move, in what appears to him a natural way, from major to minor elements. He points out the guide lines he follows in arriving at proportions for his structures; noting the importance that the bipolarity of the vertical and horizontal elements, and the forms of harmony, in particular the golden mean developed by the ancient Greeks, have in his works. He concludes with the view that the work of artists with optical illusions might be of help to physicists and psychologists. /// Chaque artiste a un besoin d'expression qui lui est propre, et son œuvre prend, après un certain temps, un caractère qui satisfait ce besoin. L'auteur pense que la structure des sculptures fondée sur le principe de la bipolarité lui permet d'avoir une forme d'expression personnelle. Le terme bipolarité se rapporte à une structure qui a deux caractéristiques ou deux natures diamétricalement opposées. Pour chaque œuvre nouvelle, l'artiste combat avec des forces antagonistes qui l'obsèdent jusqu'à ce qu'un motif, en se cristallisant, lui donne un sentiment de libération et de satisfaction esthétique. Il ordonne la structure de ses compositions de manière à ce que l'œil se déplace des éléments les plus importants vers les moins importants, ce qui lui paraît être un mouvement naturel. Il souligne les lignes directrices qu'il suit pour arriver aux proportions de ses œuvres, et note l'importance qu'ont, dans ses œuvres, la bipolarité des éléments verticaux et horizontaux, et les formes d'harmonie, en particulier la règle d'or de la Grèce antique. Pour conclure, il pense que l'œuvre d'artistes qui utilisent l'illusion d'optique pourrait apporter une aide aux savants et aux psychologues."

They are part of his research into mathematical thinking and abstract art. Concepts of structure, especially topological concepts of connectivity, are applied to the linear schemes in Mondrian's compositions. The schemes, to be regarded as networks, are then analysed in terms used in Graph Theory. The idea of the linear infra-structure is introduced as well as the idea of the formal topological image. The notion of symmetry is restated for structures, where congruence is defined topologically; as a result, the discussion of symmetry and asymmetry as applied to Mondrian's compositions is broadened. The possibility of computing the information content of linear infra-structures is discussed by the author. He investigates Mondrian's 'axioms' treating them as a restricted sub-set of possibilities allowed when composing on a square lattice. The author hopes to have shown how we could enrich our pleasure and interest in looking at Mondrian's paintings--through asking different kinds of questions relating to their structure and geometry. Furthermore the approach may be used consciously by the artist in creating his works. /// L'auteur présente des extraits de son étude sur les rapports existant entre les œuvres de Mondrian et les mathématiques. Ces extraits font partie de ses recherches sur la pensée mathématique et l'art abstrait. Des concepts de structure, et en particulier des concepts topologiques de connexité, sont appliqués aux compositions linéaires dans les œuvres de Mondrian. Ces compositions, dans lesquelles il faut voir des réseaux, sont ensuite analysées d'après la théorie des graphes. Il nous propose l'idée d'une infrastructure linéaire, ainsi que celle d'une image topologique formelle. Il précise la notion de symétrie dans les structures où la congruence est définie topologiquement, généralisant ainsi les notions de symétrie et d'assymétrie dans les compositions de Mondrian. L'auteur envisage la possibilité de calculer le contenu d'informations donné par les infrastructures linéaires. Il étudie les 'axiomes' de Mondrian en tant que sous-ensemble limité des possibilités que permet une composition sur un treillis carré. L'auteur espère montrer comment nous pouvons accroître notre plaisir et notre intérêt devant les peintures de Mondrian, en nous posant différentes questions à propos de leur structure et de leur géométrie. Et de plus, cette approche peut être consciemment utilisée par l'artiste lors de la création de ses œuvres."

The author feels that his current efforts cannot be separated from his total work, for all of them are based on two unique but related philosophical concepts. The first of these deals with his personal relationship to art, i.e. the position of the artist versus the effort. The attitude taken is an arbitrary action on his part and was adopted in conformity with personal preference and necessity. The second concept is that relating to his creative process as such. This developed gradually over a long period of time and has its own ineluctable morality. Both concepts are discussed within the vehicle of a brief personal history. Some experiences are unique, others are commonly shared with contemporaries. The culminating ideas here expressed regarding the new and the modern conception of creativity deal, primarily, with its mechanics but also with what the author hopes to accomplish in the reference frame of a new imagery. /// Il est naturel, mais impracticable, de préférer écrire seulement à propos d'une œuvre actuellement en évolution. L'auteur pense que ses efforts en cours ne peuvent être séparés de l'œuvre dans son ensemble, car ils sont tous fondés sur deux concepts philosophiques distincts quoiqu'apparentés. Le premier de ces concepts a trait à l'attitude personnelle de l'auteur envers l'art, c'est à dire à la position de l'artiste par rapport à l'effort. L'attitude qu'il prend est une action arbitraire de sa part, et a été adoptée en fonction de ses propres besoins et préférences. Le second concept a pour objet le processus créatif en tant que tel. Celui-ci s'est développé graduellement durant une longue période, et possède sa propre moralité inéluctable. Les deux concepts sont étudiés grâce à un bref aperçu biographique. Certaines expériences sont uniques, d'autres ont aussi été faites par des artistes contemporains. Les idées maîtresses développées ici, en ce qui concerne cette nouvelle et moderne conception de la créativité, ont trait principalement à ses mécanismes, mais aussi à ce que l'auteur espère accomplir dans le cadre de référence de nouvelles images."
"10.2307/1571869","Les collages de peinture ou pictocollages","Raoul Michau","Leonardo",1,"3",1968-07-01,"pp. 253-264","10.2307/1571869","The MIT Press","fla","","Les propriétés et les avantages des collages de peinture ou pictocollages ont été découverts par l'auteur à l'occasion de grandes compositions réalisées en hommage au mystique flamand Ruysbroeck l'Admirable. Ces collages ont été ensuite étendus à toutes sortes d'œuvres très diverses. Ils apportent une grande souplesse à la composition. Dans cette technique, l'élément collé est de la peinture, comme le champ où on l'introduit, et il est exécuté par l'artiste. L'œuvre est ainsi homogène. Les éléments sont peints sur papier, puis découpés ou déchirés (ce qui correspond au dessin). Le champ, fixe ou libre, est peint sur un support solide, pouvant résister aux efforts que provoquera la contraction du papier après collage. La composition se fait en présentant les éléments sur le champ et en les fixant provisoirement avec des épingles. Pour les grands formats, on peut travailler sur maquettes. Lorsque tout est arrêté et repèré, les éléments sont collés à la colle uinylique à froid. Les retouches peuvent être faites avec de la peinture ou avec des éléments peints. Toutes ces opérations: dessin, peinture, composition, collage, sont séparées et indépendantes, ce qui donne une grande liberté au travail. L'auteur analyse la technique sur des exemples, et, en se référant au précédent des grands découpages de Matisse, exécutés dans un esprit voisin de celui des pictocollages, il constate une subordination du collage à la peinture. A la limite, le collage devient invisible, et la technique décrite n'est qu'une autre manière de peindre, où le jeu des collages vient revigorer et rajeunir l'art de la peinture. /// The characteristics and advantages of painted collages or pictocollages were discovered by the author when he began large compositions in homage to the Flemish mystic, Ruysbroeck the Admirable. This type of collage was further extended to all kinds of paintings. In this technique, the glued element is made of painted paper, the same paint being used as on the foundation upon which it is glued, and it is made by the artist. The work is thus homogeneous. The elements, after being painted, are then cut or torn (this corresponds to drawing). The foundation, fixed or alterable in dimension, is painted on a strong material, able to resist the strains imposed upon it by the contraction of the glued paper elements during drying. The composition is worked out by arranging and pinning the elements on the foundation. For large sizes, one can work on reduced models. Following the composition, the location of elements is marked and then they are glued to the foundation with cold vinylic glue. Changes can then be made either directly with paint or with substituted painted elements. All the operations: drawing, painting, composing and gluing are separate and independent, giving the artist wide flexibility in his work. The author analyses this technique as used in several of his works. Referring to the huge 'découpages' by Matisse, which are closely related to the idea of pictocollages he points out that collage is submitted to painting. In the limiting case the elements of a collage become invisible and the technique becomes simply another manner of painting, where the game of collage will bring new strength and youth to the art of painting."

Coler","Leonardo",1,"3",1968-07-01,"pp. 265-272","10.2307/1571870","The MIT Press","fla","","The evolution of the study of creativity as a real interdisciplinary subject is now becoming importantly evident. Better and fresher perspective in both technology and the arts may be secured through the concept of the innovational chain, which is concerned with the entire sequence of events from the original invention to its impact on society. In this broader framework of reference, many of the views on similarities and differences between the arts and the sciences can be advantageously reassessed. The creativity involved in the 'art of technology' and the 'technology of art' may reflect a basic duality and reciprocity and not a mere felicitous turn of phrase. Obsolescing attitudes such as those dependent on the archaic role of definitions and dichotomies stand in the way of the new evolution in creativity. Simple devices which, in the words of Leonardo, 'may appear trivial and almost ludicrous' are 'nevertheless of great utility in arousing the mind to various inventions'. In this larger sense, creativity in technology and creativity in the arts are but different manifestations of invention. /// L'évolution de l'étude de la créativité en tant que véritable sujet, valable dans plusieurs disciplines, prend actuellement une importance grandissante. Le concept d'innovations en chaîne, c'est à dire de la suite complète des évènements qui découlent d'une invention mère jusqu'à son impact sur la société, procure des perspectives nouvelles et meilleures dans les domaines de la technologie et de l'art. Dans ce cadre de références élargi, il est bon de revoir certaines des théories sur les similitudes et sur les dissemblances entre l'art et les sciences. La créativité impliquée dans 'l'art de la technologie' et dans 'la technologie de l'art' peut refléter une dualité et une réciprocité fondamentales, et non simplement un heureux choix de mots. Des attitudes désuètes, comme celles fondées sur le rôle périmé des définitions et des dichotomies, font obstacle à la nouvelle évolution de l'idée de créativité. De nouvelles idées très simples qui, d'après Léonard de Vinci, 'peuvent paraître triviales et presque grotesques' sont 'néanmoins d'une grande utilité pour éveiller l'esprit á des inventions diverses'. Dans ce sens plus large, la créativité en technologie et la créativité en art ne sont que des manifestations différentes de l'invention."
"10.2307/1571871","The Ethological Command in Art","Richard G. Coss","Leonardo",1,"3",1968-07-01,"pp. 273-287","10.2307/1571871","The MIT Press","fla","","The ethological command in art is a review of certain aspects of form perception that may be influenced by biological evolution. The information from recent ethological studies, which examines the similarities between animal and human behavior, should interest the artist and augment his intuitive capacity to create aesthetic form. Many factors are involved in the evolutionary changes of most animal species. One factor that has guided the development of animal and human behavior is called selection pressure. An example of selection pressure is the need for social communication for sexual reproduction and group protection. Another category of selection pressure resides in the various dangerous animals and predators that impinge on the survival of particular animal groups. So intense is predator selection pressure that some animal species appear to have evolved unlearned recognition and avoidance of predators. The visual cues for both social signals and predator recognition are termed 'releasers' because they evoke a somewhat stereotyped reaction when viewed by certain animals. Man was certainly exposed to specific selection pressures during his long evolutionary history, and, as a result, he uses intricate social signals, such as facial expressions and body postures, for communicating emotional states during interpersonal contact. The spontaneous fear exhibited by man to snakes, scorpions and other insects with many legs suggests that these avoidance responses represent emotional by-products for survival purposes-residual from an earlier evolutionary period. If the artist desires to create an exciting piece of art, he might consider using various releasers and selected social signals to enhance the visual impact of his work. Some of the visual releasers that will be discussed comprise paired concentric circles, serrated contours and linear bands that exhibit high conspicuousness. The artist can attempt to control the viewer's arousal by selecting visual releasers that will evoke the desired response. /// Dans le domaine de l'Art, l'orientation éthologique consiste à reconsidérer certains aspects de perception des formes qui peuvent être influencés par l'évolution biologique. De récentes comparaisons éthologiques sur l'évolution du comportement animal et humain devraient être de nature à intéresser l'artiste et à augmenter sa capacité intuitive au moment de créer une forme esthétique. De nombreux facteurs agissent sur l'évolution de la plupart des espèces animales. Un premier élément, ayant guidé le développement du comportement animal et humain, est la pression sélective. Un exemple de pression sélective est le besoin de communication sociale visant à la reproduction sexuelle et à la protection du groupe. Une autre catégorie de pression sélective est illustrée par les bêtes féroces, qui réduisent le temps de survie de certaines espèces animales. La pression sélective de la bête féroce est si intense, que certaines espèces animales ont un flair inné provoquant une réaction de défense vis-à-vis des bêtes féroces. Les indices visuels des gestes de communication sociale et de détection des bêtes féroces sont appelés signes stimulants car ils évoquent une sorte de réaction type chez les animaux se trouvant en contact avec ces bêtes féroces. L'homme fut certainement exposé à des pressions sélectives précises au cours de sa longue évolution, d'où l'utilisation de gestes de communication compliqués, tels qu'expressions faciales et attitudes corporelles évoquant les états émotionnels dans les rapports humains. La peur spontanée ressentie par l'homme devant un serpent, un scorpion ou devant tout autre insecte multipattes montre que ces réactions de fuite sont des dérivés émotionnels de l'instinct de conservation, remontant à une époque antérieure de son évolution. Si l'artiste désire créer une œuvre d'art extraordinaire, il devra tenir compte de divers signes stimulants et gestes de communication pour rehausser l'impact visuel de son œuvre. Certains signes stimulants visuels, parmi ceux dont il est question, comprennent des cercles concentriques jumelés, des contours dentelés et des bandes linéaires aux formes très marquées. L'artiste peut essayer de contrôler le degré d'excitation chez l'observateur en sélectionnant des signes stimulants visuels qui évoqueront la réaction souhaitée."
"10.2307/1571872","La crise de la critique d'art","Margit Rowell","Leonardo",1,"3",1968-07-01,"pp. 289-300","10.2307/1571872","The MIT Press","fla","","L'absence d'une formation et l'absence d'une méthode semblent être à la base de ce qu'on peut appeler aujourd'hui la maladie de la critique d'art. Car, à défaut d'une discipline critique, trop souvent l'art n'est qu'un simple prétexte à écrire sa propre prose. Le but de ce papier est d'analyser les défauts majeurs qu'on trouve chez beaucoup d''usurpateurs de la fonction critique'. Cependant la bonne critique a existé et elle existe toujours. Baudelaire fut un critique d'art exemplaire. Son cas n'est pas unique. Le rôle du critique est d'élucider l'œuvre d'art. En tant que voyant il doit aider d'autres à voir. A ces fins, il lui faut une culture artistique solide et une langue précise et claire. Mais il lui faut davantage; des 'qualités spontanées' qui ne s'apprennent pas: une sensibilité artistique, un amour de l'art et une humilité devant les œuvres. La collaboration étroite entre une intelligence disciplinée et l'intuition est finalement ce qui fait le bon critique d'art. Le jugement critique se fait en plusieurs temps. D'abord subjectif, il doit atteindre une certaine objectivité. Ceci ne peut se faire qu'après une analyse technique et formelle de l'œuvre et l'étude de sa signification et de sa nécessité historique. Alors on peut énoncer un jugement critique. Et c'est alors que la fonction critique a un sens. Malheureusement trop souvent dans la presse artistique actuelle cette 'conscience critique' est absente. La crise de la critique d'art qui est le sujet de notre propos est le reflet de cet état de choses. /// Lack of specific training and a critical method seem to be at the core of what one might call the 'illness' of art criticism today. The lack of definition of what art criticism is or should be tempts many to lean on art to write their own prose. Our aim is to analyse the major faults of this kind of art writing which usurps and often even tends to negate the critic's function. Good criticism existed in the past and it exists in the present. Baudelaire was an exemplary critic. His case is by no means unique. The critic's role is to elucidate the work of art. As a kind of visionary, he should help others to see through his eyes. This requires a solid artistic background and experience, and a language which is clear and precise. But these qualifications are not enough. Great sensitivity, a love of art and humility in front of works of art are also necessary to his profession. These cannot be learned. Thus it is the close collaboration of disciplined intelligence and intuition that makes the good critic. Critical judgment is built on several successive phases of experience. Purely subjective reactions must become objective through the conscientious analysis of a work of art: forms, technique, meaning, historical necessity. Only then is critical judgment possible. And only then is art criticism meaningful. Unfortunately, what we call 'critical conscience' is lacking in much art writing today. It is for that reason that one can speak of a 'crisis' in reference to contemporary art criticism."

Alcopley","Leonardo",1,"1",1968-01-01,"pp. 3-16","10.2307/1571900","The MIT Press","fla","","A drawing is defined as an image in which the composition of lines predominates over considerations of color. Drawings are conceived by the author as structures and non-structures, although any drawing is bound to be structural. In the drawings as non-structures, the elements of the unexpected, accidental, and automatic play a dominant role. In a drawing as a structure, any line must be deeply felt, and drawn on a surface with the conviction that it is necessary where it is placed. By surface is meant the entire picture surface which cannot be divided or separated to show merely any portion covered by lines. These drawings are considered as structures, because in them there is the arrangement of all the parts to the whole. The structure drawings are discussed under the following seven groupings: structures of things (including landscapes), structures of space, structures of the spoken, structures of signs, structures drawn to poems, dimension of time structures and structures drawn to music. The significance of size and of proportions in drawings as structures and non-structures is stressed, and special consideration is given to the largeness inherent in certain small-sized and even tiny-sized works of art. The author's minimum drawings are discussed both as single pictures and as assemblages. Three-dimensionality is shown not merely in superimposed drawings, but also in the author's vertical sky-scraper pictures and his horizontal promenade pictures, in which the dimension of time enters in the viewing of the picture by the beholder. The author emphasizes that his pictures, both drawings and paintings, differ fundamentally from the pictures by artists of ancient China and Japan, because of the entirely different conceptions of space. An attempt is made to correlate today's world view of science as a product of Western thought and the author's letterless writing. The latter is not any form of calligraphy either practiced in the orient or in abstractions by modern artists--of the West and East--who still suggest some definite meaning of letters, ideograms, or hieroglyphs. /// Un dessin se définit comme une image dans laquelle la disposition de lignes l'emporte sur les considérations de couleur. Les dessins ont été conçus par l'auteur en tant que structures et non-structures, bien que tout dessin soit obligatoirement structuré. Pour ce qui est des dessins considérés comme non-structures, les éléments tels que l'inattendu, l'accidentel et l'automatisme jouent un rôle essentiel. Dans un dessin considéré comme structure chaque ligne doit avoir été profondément sentie et dessinée sur une surface avec la conviction qu'elle doit s'y trouver nécessairement où elle est placée. On entend par surface la totalité du tableau qui ne saurait être divisée ou séparée du reste, afin de ne montrer qu'une portion de l'ensemble recouverte de lignes. Ces dessins sont dits en tant que structures parce qu'en ce qui les concerne il y a corrélation entre toutes ses parties et l'ensemble. Les dessins en tant que structures ont été classés dans les sept groupes ci-après: structures d'objets (y compris les paysages), structures de l'espace, structures de la parole, structures de signes, structures dessinées d'après des poèmes, dimension dessinees d'après structure temporelle, et structures de la musique. La signification de la dimension et des proportions des dessins considérés en tant que structures et non-structures est soulignée mise en évidence tandis qu'une considération particulière est accordée à l'espace inhérent à certaines oeuvres d'art de petites ou très petites dimensions. Les minimum dessins de l'auteur sont considérés aussi bien en tant qu'oeuvres isolées que comme des ensembles. La tri-dimensionalité est visible non seulement dans les dessins superposés mais aussi bien dans les tableaux gratte-ciels, verticales de l'auteur que ses tableaux panoramiques horizontales dans lesquels la dimension temporelle entre dans la vision de l'oeuvre par le spectateur. L'auteur insiste sur le fait que ses oeuvres, à la fois des dessins que ses peintures, sont essentiellement différents de celles réalisées par les artistes de l'ancienne Chine et du Japon, en raison de leur conception entièrement différente de l'espace. Il a tenté de faire un rapprochement entre la conception universelle, moderne de la science comme un produit de la pensée occidentale et l'écriture sans lettres de l'auteur. Cette écriture n'est pas une forme quelconque de la calligraphie pratiquée en Orient ou des abstractions réalisées par les artistes modernes--en Occident ou en Orient--qui suggèrent encore une signification définie des lettres, des idéogrammes ou des hiéroglyphes."

Unlike them, however, I feel sure that those laws ought not to be restricted to rules derived from geometry. For me every human phenomenon contains a complete instruction-book for my special kind of activity. In my weaker moments I tell myself how enchanting an idea it would be if my neighbours compared me with the little James Watt looking at the steam coming from his mother's tea-kettle. But, of course, I am not alone at finding myself at this starting-point. I think of, for example, Kowalski who, with his underwater explosions and other experiments is letting the forces of nature work for him. As a sculptor I am prepared to learn everything from nature, not in the way of Arp or Moore, but in the way already pointed out by Thomas d'Aquinas (imitatio naturae in operatione). But at the same time I am willing to learn from writers and entertainers, from the Bible and Shakespeare, to Eartha Kitt and Bertha von Paraboum. I may be inspired by the way the wash is hanging from a clothes line (see my: 'Shanty Town') or the way the light is playing on the streets of New York (see my: 'Homage to Sam Rodia'). Sometimes I use the simple principle of laying stones one on top of the other (see my: 'Egelstelling'). The driving force behind everything I do is, I suppose, my permanent discontent with my visual surroundings. I try to improve in the first place, of course, the things that are within my reach--for instance the several living-rooms that I have owned in my life. From creating my own environment spring the ideas for my work as a whole. In this sense architecture, sculpture, painting and design have for me become one. I am an integrationist. /// Tout comme les constructivistes, je crois aux lois objectives qui gouvernent nos prétendues 'œuvres-d'Art'. Mais contrairement à eux, je suis certain que ces lois ne devraient pas se limiter à celles dérivées de la géométrie. Quant à moi, tout phénomène humain contient un manuel complet pour le genre d'activité qui est la mienne. Dans mes moments de doute, je me dis comme ce serait merveilleux si mes contemporains pouvaient me comparer au jeune James Watt regardant la vapeur s'échapper de la bouilloire de sa maman. Mais, bien sûr, je ne suis pas le seul à me trouver à ce point de départ. Je pense, par exemple, à Kowalski qui dans ses explosions sous-marines et ses autres expériences laisse aux forces de la Nature le soin de travailler pour lui. Comme sculpteur, je suis prêt à accepter tout ce que m'enseigne la Nature, non pas dans le même sens qu'Arp ou Moore, mais de la manière qu'évoquait déjà St Thomas d'Aquib (imitatio naturae in operatione). Néanmoins, je désire tout autant m'instruire grâce à ce qu'enseignent les écrivains et les amuseurs publics, grâce à la Bible et à Shakespeare, Eartha Kitt et Bertha von Paraboum. Je pourrais trouver mon inspiration en observant comment la lessive est accrochée sur la corde à linge (voir mon 'Shanty Town') ou encore la manière dont la lumière joue dans les rues de New York (voir mon 'Hommage à Sam Rodia'). Il m'arrive d'utiliser un principe fort simple, en disposant des pierres les unes sur les autres (comme pour mon 'Egelstelling'). La force motrice qui agit dans tout ce que je fais c'est, je le suppose, mon permanent mécontentement face à mon entourage visuel. Pour commencer, bien entendu, j'essaie d'améliorer les objets qui sont à ma portée. Par exemple, les divers intérieurs que j'ai occupés au cours de ma vie. A partir de la création du décor qui m'entoure je puise les idées dont je me sers pour l'ensemble de mon œuvre. Dans cet esprit-là, l'architecture, la sculpture, la peinture et le dessin ne forment plus pour moi qu'un seul et même tout. Je suis un intégrationniste."

Il est à la portée de tous, grâce aux éléments standardisés, dont on peut composer un trés grand nombre de permutations équivalentes. Cette personnalisation est recherchée par tous, les artistes y compris, ceux-ci devant assurer aussi la mission de fabriquer des combinaisons 'porteuses de messages'. Un objet sans message déchiffrable cesse d'être objet d'art, il n'est qu'un canular. Le message peut être composé à partir de 'complexes' ou de 'simplexes'. Le déchiffrage des 'complexes' n'a pas encore atteint le domaine public, mais il peut être appris. L'architecte ne doit pas être un artiste, car une ville n'est pas faite pour porter un message. L'architecte doit créer un système technique donnant à l'habitant le droit à la personnalisation (par permutations). C'est l'architecture mobile (ou urbanisme spatial) qui semble le seul système capable de donner cette liberté; la ville nouvelle amènerait alors la formation d'un nouveau folklore. La ville ne portant pas de message collectif n'est pas observable comme 'oeuvre d'art' par les non-habitants. Par contre, en tant que mécanisme, la ville reste parfaitement observable par les 'naturalistes'. En conclusion, si l'artiste doit se soucier que son message soit compréhensible, l'architecte, lui, doit organiser le 'code' technique (autrement dit, l'infrastructure) qui permettra n'importe quel message. /// The greatest modern privilege is the right to be an individual. Standard elements of construction contribute to this fight by making possible a great number of useful permutations. To be a unique individual is the target of everyone, including artists, but in order to be an artist one must be able to communicate individuality in a way that can be understood by everyone. Artists make objects that carry a message, but if the message is not decodable by others, the object is not a work of art--it is a 'practical joke.' Messages can be composed of 'complexes' or 'simplexes.' Today we can almost decode 'complexes,' and soon we will be able to teach its principles. Architects cannot be artists, for a city is not constructed to carry messages. Architects should create technical building systems that will permit anyone to manifest his own personality in his environment by selecting his preferred permutations within such systems. Mobile architectural systems (systems of spatial urbanism) are, it appears, the only ones capable of providing this liberty. The spatial city makes it possible for the city-shape to become a new folklore. Since cities do not carry messages, one cannot look upon a city as a work of art, except if one lives there. On the other hand, the city can be studied by 'naturalists'. In conclusion the author points out that if an artist must worry about his message being understood, a town planner must provide technical elements (or a technical 'code' or infrastructure) within which any individual 'message' can be composed."

Tels sont: dans l'Antiquité, le poète selon Platon, ignorant inspiré, qui ne sait ce qu'il dit mais par la bouche duquel parle un dieu; à la Renaissance, l'artiste sans cesse agité de fureurs héroïques; dans le Romantisme, l'artiste révolté social, voué par la force intérieure du génie à de grandes aventures vitales, dont son art n'est qu'une partie. Plus récemment, on a souvent considéré l'artiste comme un grand émotif, dont l'activité consiste, sous le choc d'une circonstance externe, à projeter sa vie intérieure, et particulièrement son inconscient, dans une forme spécifique déterminée par une vocation. Mais l'époque contemporaine montre à l'observateur une foule d'artistes extrêmement différents de ces personnages mythiques. Et ce type nouveau d'artiste doit obliger l'esthétique à reconsidérer la plupart de ses théories traditionnelles. L'artiste d'aujourd'hui est très souvent polyvalent (à la fois poète et peintre, ou peintre et musicien, etc.). Même il tente des æuvres échappant à toutes les classifications anciennes. Il est avant tout un chercheur. Il ne compte pas sur l'inspiration ou l'enthousiasme mais sur un travail constructif plus analogue à celui de l'ingénieur qu'à celui de l'artiste des mythes traditionnels. Il travaille méthodiquement et aime à réfléchir sur son art et sur ses voies et moyens. Bref, sa mentalité est souvent assez proche de celle de l'homme de science. D'où la nécessité d'une nouvelle définition de l'art, répondant au personnage moderne de l'artiste. /// The major aesthetic theories which recur in all epochs in the history of art are dominated by the conception of the personality of the artist, a conception which at times may coincide with the social reality of the artist, but which is also often a kind of myth. Thus in Antiquity, one has the Poet according to Plato--an inspired ignoramus--mouthpiece of the gods--uttering words beyond his own comprehension; the Renaissance artist, restlessly driven by tumultuous heroic fervors; and in the Romantic Period, the artist in revolt against social conditions, swept by genius' inner stimulation into vital epic adventures where his art played but a small part. More recently, the artist has often been regarded as a supersensitive being, whose principal activity, under the impact of external circumstances, is to display his inner life, and, in particular, his subconscious, in a specific form determined by his vocation. The contemporary epoch, however, has produced a whole crowd of artists extremely different from these mythical figures. And it is because of this new type of artist that aesthetics must reform most of its traditional theories. The artist of today is very often polyvalent (both poet and painter, or painter and musician, etc.). He attempts to create works which elude all the established classifications. He is above all a researcher. He does not rely on inspiration or enthusiasm, but on constructive work more analogous to that of the engineer than to that of the artist of the traditional myths. He works methodically and likes to reason about his art, its ways and means. In short, his mentality is often similar to that of the man of science. From this arises the need for a new definition of art, which will correspond to the modern conception of the artist."

Waddington","Leonardo",1,"1",1968-01-01,"pp. 69-75","10.2307/1571907","The MIT Press","fla","","It is unusual today for anyone engaged in one particular field to write about another, but new developments in any particular field only become part of general culture when they enter the experience of people not specializing in that area. Thus the author, a scientist, feels he is justified in writing about painting. He finds that painting during the last half-century is too diverse for there to be a simple relation between painting and science. Most of the painting prevailing during this period has some ascertainable connexion with science. Man will never reach finality in his scientific attempts to express his understanding of the world, nor will painters cease to explore new ways of creating aesthetically valuable objects which reflect the ways in which the nature of the physical and social world enters their intelligence and feelings. He points out that the natural sciences and painting, although related in some ways, are quite different in their essential aims. Artists judge the basic importance of their work by applying a totally different criterion from that which is used by a scientist. Nevertheless, man cannot produce anything which has solely an aesthetic impact and no conceptual meaning; nor can he produce anything that is purely scientific without providing any basis from which aesthetic creation is possible. With the cracking of the atom, consideration must be made of the world as made of things much more like vertebrates--soft on the outside, but with a solid skeleton structure within. The challenge one might throw out to painters is, how far can they express the underlying hard skeletal structure without sacrificing the great advances they have made in exhibiting the softness of the immediately apparent outside of the fundamental elements of our experience. Because for science both are equally essential. But the author says it would be a mistake to see the traffic between art and science as a one-way affair. Science, of course, cannot expect to learn scientific truths from the productions of artists, any more than the latter can get much profit from merely taking over the superficial appearance of intellectual concepts of science. But a scientist by looking at paintings or experiencing other kinds of art, can loosen the joints of his psyche and give himself a chance to dredge up from the obscure internal depths something--which will probably not have the slightest obvious connexion with the work of art he has been contemplating--which may be fresh enough to be worth while. /// Il n'est guère fréquent, aujourd'hui, que quelqu'un abandonne son sujet particulier pour se mettre à écrire sur un autre sujet; mais dans tous les domaines, de nouveaux développments deviennent une partie de la culture générale, lorsqu'ils aboutissent à l'expérience de ceux qui n'étaient pas spécialisés de tels sujets. C'est ainsi qu'un pur scientifique se sent apte à écrire sur un sujet tel que 'la peinture'. Il trouve que la peinture, pendant la dernier demi-siècle, a trop de diversité pour qu'il soit aisé d'établir un rapport entre science et peinture. Beaucoup de peintres de la dernière période sentent et expriment un certain rapport entre la peinture et la science. L'homme n'arrivera jamais à un point final, dans ses tentatives pour exprimer une compréhension totale du monde. De même, les peintres ne cesseront jamais des procédés (pour créer, par l'esthétique) des œuvres de valeur seflétant la manière dont la nature (ou le monde physique et social) pénètre dans leur intelligence et dans leurs sentiments. L'artiste nous démontre que la peinture et les sciences naturelles (bien qu'ayant des relations apparentes) diffèrent totalement en ce qui concerne leur but. Les artistes jugent l'importance et la base de leur travail selon un criterium tout-à-fait différent de celui de l'homme de science. Il n'en est pas moins vrai que l'homme ne peut produire une œuvre uniquement artistique, sans autre signification; de même, il peut produire une œuvre purement scientifique sans les bases qui amènent à la création esthétique. Depuis la découverte de l'atome, il faut considérer le monde comme l'on considère le vertebre: d'un exterieur tendre et doux, mais sous lequel existe une solide structure squeletique. Le problème que l'on peut poser aux peintres est le suivant: comment exprimer la force d'une structure intérieure solide sans sacrifier le grand progrès accompli en présentant la douceur de l'apparence extérieure, en ce qui concerne les éléments essentiels de notre expérience. Dans le domaine de la science, l'un et l'autre domaine sont essentiels. Mais l'auteur dit qu'il y aurait erreur à considérer les rapports entre l'art et la science comme une affaire sans importance. Il est évident que les hommes de science ne peuvent pas apprendre les réalités scientifiques en se basant sur les productions artistiques; de même, l'artiste ne peut s'inspirer de la conceptions scientifique. Mais l'homme de science, en considérant la peinture ou s'inspirant de toute autre forme d'art, peut perdre certains liens psychologiques et peut faire l'experiencé d'une obscurité interne (sans connection, peut-être, avec l'œuvre contemplée) mais qui, par sa nouveauté, vaut la peine d'être ressentie."

A similar aim controls his handling of colour. He believes a patch of colour should 'tell' and be a unique statement on its own within the design of the whole, avoiding repetitions and over-all patterns. He regards all colours as equals, including black and white. The only criterion in his choice of a colour is its value in creating a design and atmosphere demanded by the subject. In his search for a more effective expression he began in 1943 a series of black and white studies. Concurrently with these black and white studies he attempted to develop a more concise form in his paintings without neglecting the ideas behind the pictures. He believes that the creation of meaningful form can only be successful when the signs forming a composition stem from the idea of the composition itself. /// Dupuis le début de sa carrière de peintre, l'auteur a, dans ses compositions, essayé de réduire le dessin à sa plus simple expression. Son utilisation des couleurs répond au même but. Il pense qu'une tache de couleur doit 'parler' et être en elle-même un témoignage uniqué compris dans la composition de l'ensemble. Il faut donc éviter les répétitions et les motifs développés à l'excès. Il considère que toutes les couleurs sont sur le même plan, y compris le noir et le blanc. Le seul critère suivi dans le choix de ses couleurs est leur valeur créative par rapport au dessin et à l'atmosphère exigés par le sujet. Dans sa recherche d'une expression plus efficace, il commença en 1943 une série d'études en noir et blanc. Parallèlement, il essaya de mettre une plus grande concision dans ses œuvres, sans pour autant négliger les idées qui les inspiraient. En effet, il croit que la création d'une forme significative ne peut être réussie que lorsque les signes qui la composent émanent de l'idée de la composition même."

A study of the paintings of De Hooch and Vermeer was also helpful from the point of view of the way those artists were able to control their large shapes, even when disparate elements were included within these shapes. Also, the author describes the influence upon him of examples of Chinese paintings and his method of working with mounted layers of torn papers.

He calls abstract art transcendental art because it transcends the limitations of the classical art of Greece and Rome and of the Renaissance. He believes the conception of abstract art, in which one considers a painting 'in itself', with its terms of reference 'within itself', is related in some aspects to art produced in the East, that is, Japan, China and India. He gives three guide lines for abstract art that are the result of the work of the Western pioneers of this form of Art. He then points out the differences in approach of Kandinsky, Mondrian and himself in making a work. The author discusses at some length the work of Mondrian and his personal acquaintance with him, which began in 1924. Although the two of them agreed on many points of abstract art, the author refused to be limited by Mondrian's obsession with straight lines at right angles and with a limited palette. The author's aims and methods of making picture-objects or reliefs are presented, together with examples of works he has produced during the past forty years. /// L'auteur expose brièvement le developpement de l'art abstrait parmi les groupes d'artistes en France, en Allemagne, en Hollande et en Russie pendant les années 1910-1916. Il appelle l'art abstrait art transcendental car il dépasse les limitations de l'art classique de la Grèce, de Rome, et de la Renaissance. L'auteur pense que cette conception de l'art abstrait, selon laquelle on voit un tableau 'en lui-même', c'est à dire contenant 'en lui-même' ses propres critères de référence, est, par certains aspects, proche de celle des pays d'Extrême-Orient: Japon, Chine et Inde. Il indique trois lignes directrices de l'art abstrait, lignes qui résultent du travail des pionniers occidentaux de cette forme d'art. Il démontre ensuite les différences qui existent entre les démarches de travail suivies respectivement par Kandinsky, par Mondrian et par lui-même. L'auteur s'étend quelque peu sur l'œuvre de Mondrian et sur le fait qu'il l'a connu personnellement, à partir de 1924. Ces deux artistes sont d'accord sur de nombreux points concernant l'art abstrait, toutefois l'auteur refuse de se laisser limiter par l'obsession de Mondrian de n'utiliser que des lignes droites se coupant à angle droit, et une palette réduite.

Il étudie ceux qui ont été présentés comme ses précurseurs en'décollage' (l'Oberdada Baader et le surréaliste Malet), puis comment, en collectionnant ses affiches agressées, il est devenu une personnalité lacérée. Car ces œuvres sont faites par des lacérateurs anonymes à qui il attribue, entre autres mérites, celui d'avoir introduit, par la déchirure, antidote contre toute propagande, la publicité au domaine de l'heureusement illisible. /// Etienne Souriau in the first number of ""Leonardo"" described the contemporary artist as becoming close to being an engineer. Villeglé in his article discusses the modern artist in terms of an artist of the past with 'traditional myths' who is now confronted with an inherent ambiguity because the new criterion of creation is sudden passion. After explaining that the introduction fifty years ago of common utilitarian objects into art caused general confusion, the author points out that his works and the motives for producing them are different. He reviews the work of his predecessors in the decollage technique (Oberdada Baader and the surrealist Malet) and discusses how he evolved, while collecting torn posters, into a lacerated personality. Since his torn poster works are made by anonymous persons, he says that, among other qualities, they provide an antidote to propaganda because publicity posters have been made happily unintelligible."
"10.2307/1571924","Liquid Crystals: A New Material for Artists","Rein Lemberg","Leonardo",2,"1",1969-01-01,"pp. 45-50","10.2307/1571924","The MIT Press","fla","","Liquid crystals have the unusual property of responding to changes in temperature with striking changes in colour. Since these changes can also take place in the range of room temperatures, the crystals have potential value for artists. These organic materials seem to possess two sharp and distinct melting points between which they are said to be in the 'liquid crystal' state. Liquid crystals are classified as nematic, smectic and cholesteric, depending on their molecular structure. Cholesteric liquid crystals, which are composed of cholesterol ester derivatives with eccentric molecular structures, are the most interesting. They respond not only to variations of temperature but also to mechanical stress, electromagnetic radiation and chemical environment with chamelion-like colour changes. The combination of colours exhibited by a particular liquid crystal depends on its chemical composition, on the magnitude of the applied stress and on the relative angles of illumination and viewing. A recent process, called encapsulation, permits liquid crystals to be produced in a convenient form which is durable and easy to use. The techniques of application of the liquid crystals as surface coatings are presented and current uses of these materials are outlined. Possible future developments are also mentioned but the question of how liquid crystals may be used by artists is left open. /// Les cristaux liquides sont dotés de la propriété inhabituelle de réagir aux changements de température par des changements de couleur frappants. Comme ces changements peuvent aussi se produire quand la température ambiante des pièces varie, ces cristaux ont une grande valeur pour les artistes. Ces matériaux organiques semblent posséder deux points de fusion bien définis et distincts, entre lesquels ils sont dans l'état appelé 'cristal liquide'. Les cristaux liquides sont classés en nématiques, smectiques, et cholestériques selon leur structure moléculaire. Les cristaux liquides cholestériques, composés de dérivés esters du cholestérol avec des structures moléculaires excentrées, sont les plus intéressants. Ils réagissent non seulement aux variations de température, mais aussi aux contraintes mécaniques, aux radiations électromagnétiques et à l'environnement chimique avec des changements de couleurs dignes d'un caméléon. La combinaison de couleurs d'un cristal liquide particulier dépend de sa combinaison chimique, de la valeur des contraintes appliquées, et des angles relatifs sous lequel il est illuminé et sous lequel on le voit. Grâce à un procédé nouveau, appelé 'encapsulation', les cristaux liquides sont maintenant produits sous une forme commode qui est durable et facile d'emploi. Les techniques d'application des cristaux liquides en tant que revêtements de surfaces sont présentées dans le rapport, et on indique les emplois courants de ces matériaux. Les développements futurs possibles sont également mentionnés, mais la question de savoir comment les cristaux liquides peuvent être utilisés par les artistes n'est pas abordée."

For me this is necessary since I work on two levels from a common set of attitudes: on the social level, elaborating plans for a Cybernetic Art Matrix; on the intimate level making individual art works. Both processes are concerned with creating triggers--initiating creative behaviour in the observer/participant. Modern art is characterized by a behaviourist tendency in which process and system are cardinal factors. As distinctions between music, painting, poetry, etc. become blurred and media are mixed, a behaviourist synthesis is seen to evolve, in which dialogue and feedback within a social culture indicate the emergence of a Cybernetic vision in art as in science. My artifacts come out of a process of random behaviour interacting with pre-established conditions. The Cybernetic Art Matrix is seen as a process in which anarchic group behaviour interacts with pre-established systems of communications, hardware and learning nets. In both cases the processes are self-generating and self-critical. Basically they are initiated by creative behaviour, and in turn give rise to its extension in other people. /// Il existe un paradoxe apparent en ce que, comme artistes, nous nous orientons peu à peu vers un processus tout en continuant à produire des objets d'art. Dans mon cas cela est nécessaire parce que je travaille sur deux plans, à partir d'un ensemble commun d'attitudes: sur le plan social, en élaborant des projets pour une Matrice d'Art Cybernétique; sur le plan individuel, en créant des oeuvres d'art personnelles. Ces deux processus ont pour but de susciter des déclics--ils déclenchent un comportement créateur chez le spectateur-participant. L'art moderne est caractérisé par une tendance behaviouriste dont le processus et le système sont les facteurs essentiels. Du fait que les différences entre la musique, la peinture, la poésie, etc., tendent à s'estomper et que les media se confondent, l'élaboration d'une synthèse behaviouriste est indispensable, où le dialogue et le 'feedback' au sein d'une culture sociale désignent l'émergence d'une Vision Cybernétique de l'art et des sciences. Les objets que j'ai réalisés sont le résultat d'un processus du comportement, laissé au hasard, et mis en relation avec des conditions pré-établies. La Matrice d'art Cybernétique est envisagée comme étant un processus dans lequel un comportement anarchique de groupe est mis en contact avec des systèmes de communication pré-établis, du matériel et des réseaux d'enseignement. Dans les deux cas, les processus se créent et se contrôlent eux-mêmes. Ils sont, à la base, issus d'un comportement créateur et donnent, à leur tour, l'élan à son développement chez le spectateur."

Hoenich","Leonardo",1,"2",1968-04-01,"pp. 113-120","10.2307/1571948","The MIT Press","fla","","In the author's opinion the techniques of art should at any time equal and mirror the tendencies of development and the spiritual and scientific levels of their epoch. He describes his own work with the following new techniques of art: 1. The 'Robot-Picture'--This is a moving and changing sunlight projection system which repeats itself yearly. The artist can fully control this technique and pre-determine a year's programme. 2. The 'Robot-Painter'--This, too, is a moving and changing sunlight projection system, but it never repeats itself. With this system the artist cannot foresee the individual pictures that will be produced, but he determines the style of the pictures by choosing the shapes and motion of the reflecting elements in the 'robot'. Both systems make use of Sun rays and of the rotation and revolution of the Earth; however, the 'Robot-Painter' requires an additional source of power for producing irregular movements of the reflecting elements in the 'robot'. The author has used wind energy for this task. /// Selon l'auteur, les techniques en matière d'art devraient toujours correspondre aux tendances du développement de leur époque et à son niveau spirituel et scientifique. Il décrit sa propre œuvre comme l'utilisation des nouvelles techniques artistiques suivantes. 1. Le 'Tableau-Robot'--Il s'agit d'un système de projection mobile et changeante de la lumière solaire, qui se répète tous les ans. L'artiste a la possibilité de contrôler parfaitement cette technique et de déterminer ainsi à l'avance le programme de toute une année. 2. Le 'Peintre-Robot'--Il s'agit, ici encore, d'un système mobile et changeant de projection de la lumière solaire, mais ne se répétant jamais. En utilisant ce système, l'artiste ne peut prévoir quels tableaux seront réalisés, mais c'est lui qui décide du style des tableaux en choisissant les formes et le mouvement des éléments réfléchissants du 'robot'. Ces deux systèmes utilisent, l'un et l'autre, les rayons solaires, la rotation et les révolutions de la Terre; néanmoins, le 'Peintre-Robot' a besoin d'une force motrice additionnelle pour produire les mouvements irréguliers des éléments réfléchissants du 'robot'. L'auteur, pour sa part, a utilisé à cette fin la force du vent."

Throughout the period of simultaneous performance there was much evidence reported by each individual that a form of unplanned communication took place between them that influenced the musical and visual compositions they created. The only preparation made before the performance described was the previously developed competence of each artist with the piano and the Chromara instrument. This experiment provides, perhaps, further insight into the possibilities of communicating vast amounts of information without resorting to the complicated syntax and vocabulary of ordinary language. /// A l'aide d'un instrument nouveau, le Chromara de l'auteur, qui 'peint' avec un jeu de lumières sur un écran translucide en fonction du temps, et d'un piano, deux artistes, interprétant sur leur instrument respectif, coordonnèrent leurs efforts à fin de fournir une seule composition unifiée.

Still contemporary architects and builders of our cities have not yet understood that the close association of glass painting with architecture enhances the latter. The author points out that the capabilities of stained glass have not yet been fully explored, and that they are challenging to the contemporary artist. For many centuries artists neglected or ignored the innate possibilities of this medium, and glass painting was done in the same manner as oil painting. Different techniques which the author has employed are described. She stresses that in many of her glass paintings the lines of the leading are used as part of the design to make graphic structures between the plates of colored glass. Her use of antique glass is related to its textures, different thicknesses and varying tonalities. Other methods are mentioned as to how desired textures can be produced and the way in which both opaque and transparent glass, as well as fused glass, are employed in her work. The author shows that electrically illuminated glass paintings do not necessarily need an architectural setting and that glass paintings, when installed in a room of a museum, in an entrance hall or in a private home, can provide the splendor of light and color. Rooms providing an interplay of light and color and an atmosphere conducive to meditation are considered by the author of particular need in our time for mental relaxation, better concentration, valuable visual experience and pleasure. The author also proposes ceiling murals, made of stained glass, evenly lit from above. The creative process of paintings of stained glass is the same as in all the arts. The author expresses the belief that, in spite of current trends to overemphasise the creative process, it is the finished work of art which, as in the past, will determine its merits, regardless whether or not it has been appreciated in the time it was created. Finally, she points out that in glass paintings it is the light, whether natural or artificial, that is the most important element: for it appears as if the source of light is in the colored glass itself and one has the feeling of being taken into distant space. /// L'utilisation du verre coloré est intimement liée à l'architecture. Pourtant, les architectes contemporains et les constructeurs de nos cités ne semblent pas avoir encore compris l'étroite association du verre coloré à l'architecture, qu'il rehausse et met en valeur. L'auteur insiste sur le fait que les possibilités qu'offre le verre de couleur n'ont pas été jusqu'ici entièrement explorées et qu'elles constituent une sollicitation pour l'artiste contemporain. Au cours des siècles, les artistes ont négligé, voire ignoré les possibilités inhérentes à cette technique, si bien que la peinture sur verre était exécutée de la même manière que la peinture à l'huile. L'auteur décrit les diverses techniques qu'elle utilise. Elle insiste sur le fait que dans un grand nombre de ses œuvres, les lignes de l'armature en plomb constituent, elles aussi, une partie du dessin afin de réaliser des structures graphiques pour relier entre elles les surfaces de verre coloré. Elle utilise le verre ancien à cause de sa texture, de ses différentes épaisseurs, et de ses tonalités variables. L'auteur cite certaines autres méthodes en indiquant de quelle façon on obtient les textures voulues et de quelle manière le verre, opaque ou transparent, et le verre réuni par fusion, sont employés dans ses œuvres. L'auteur démontre que les vitraux éclairés à l'électricité n'exigent pas nécessairement un encadrement architectural et qu'installés dans une salle de musée, dans un Hall ou dans une demeure particulière, ils peuvent diffuser une lumière colorée splendide. Les pièces disposant d'une harmonie de lumière et de couleur et d'une atmosphère propice à la méditation sont, d'après l'auteur, tout particulièrement nécessaires de nos jours pour favoriser la relaxation mentale, une meilleure concentration de l'esprit, une expérience visuelle précieuse autant qu'agréable. Elle nous propose également des panneaux de verre coloré fixés au plafond, que l'on éclaire uniformément par le haut. Le processus créateur, en ce qui concerne le verre coloré, est le même que celui de tous les autres arts. L'auteur ajoute qu'en dépit des tendances actuelles qui visent surtout à exagérer ce processus de création, c'est l'œuvre une fois achevée qui, comme le passé, doit révéler ses mérites, que l'œuvre ait été, ou non, appréciée lors de sa création. Enfin, l'auteur insiste sur le fait qu'en ce qui concerne le verre coloré, c'est la lumière, naturelle ou artificielle, qui en consistue l'élément essentiel; c'est elle qui donne au spectateur l'impression que la source lumineuse provient du verre de couleur lui-même et l'entraîne à travers les espaces infinis."

Bohm","Leonardo",1,"2",1968-04-01,"pp. 137-149","10.2307/1571951","The MIT Press","fla","","Creativity cannot be defined in words, but one can perhaps at least begin to indicate what it is in an oblique and indirect way, by asking why scientists are so deeply interested in their work. By eliminating many of the generally accepted but superficial answers to these questions, one soon discovers that a scientist is seeking to learn something different from what can be inferred from previous knowledge, something leading ultimately to a new perception of the wholeness, beauty and harmony in the order and structure of natural process. Such a perception is akin to what is sought, although in a very different way, by the artist, the musician, the architect, and indeed by all who are engaged in truly creative action. Nevertheless, it is necessary to be more precise about what is meant by the notion of creativity. What is order? What is structure? What is process? In this article, these questions are considered, and certain answers are suggested, at least in a provisional way. The meanings of these suggestions are brought out in several examples, drawn mainly from the actual history of the development of science, but not entirely restricted to this field. The question is then raised as to what is preventing the vast majority of human beings from being really creative, except perhaps on rather rare occasions. Further discussion suggests that in a way, the creative possibilities of the mind are generally dormant. This state of 'sleep' is probably the result of a very widespread and deep confusion between the creative and the mechanical. As a result of this confusion it is very hard even to perceive that one is not creative. The essay concludes with a brief discussion of what it would mean to be free of this confusion, and how such freedom might perhaps come into being. /// Vouloir définir par des mots la capacité d'invention est chose malaisée, ou peut du moins essayer d'indiquer de quoi il s'agit en utilisant des moyens détournés, indirects, en se demandant pour quelle raison les chercheurs s'intéressent si passionnément à leurs travaux. En procédant par élimination, en supprimant les réponses nombreuses et superficielles généralement admises, on ne tarde pas à découvrir que le chercheur s'efforce d'apprendre quelque chose de nouveau, autre que ce qui peut être déduit d'après des connaissances acquises, quelque chose qui pourra aboutir à une nouvelle perception de l'intégralité, de la beauté et de l'harmonie dans l'ordre et la structure du processus naturel. Recherche très comparable à celle de l'artiste, du musicien, de l'architecte et de tous ceux qui sont engagés dans une activité de création véritable, quoique par des moyens très différents. Il convient néanmoins d'être plus précis lorsqu'il s'agit de définir ce que l'on entend par la notion d'invention créatrice. Qu'est-ce que l'ordre? Qu'est-ce que la structure? Qu'est-ce que le processus? Ces questions sont examinées et certaines réponses sont données dans le présent article, des réponses provisoires tout au moins. Les significations de ces suggestions sont illustrées par plusieurs exemples, pris dans l'histoire actuelle du développement des sciences, quoique pas uniquement restreints à ce domaine. Reste à savoir pour quelle raison la très grande majorité des êtres humains sont dépourvus de cette capacité créatrice, sauf peut-être en de très rares occasions. Un examen plus poussé indique que dans un certain sens les possibilités créatrices de l'esprit humain sont en général latentes. Cet état de 'sommeil' est probablement dû à une confusion très répandue et profondément ancrée, qui consiste à ne pas faire la distinction entre création et mécanique. L'étude se termine par un bref exposé sur ce à quoi l'on aboutirait si l'on arrivait à se libèrer d'une telle confusion et de quelle manière cette libération pourrait devenir effective, un jour."

He places the subject in historical perspective and links it to other areas--art, science and technology. Artists for long years have been concerned with travelers whether they went by carriage or coach, clipper ship or river boat, streetcar or railroad train, as well as with the landscapes, road views and mountain scene the travelers saw. He points out the influence artists have had on architecture, printing, furniture and other everyday objects, and on the design of airplanes, automobiles and trains. The interest of the contemporary artist in various aspects of today's life is manifested by Op, Pop and Kinetic art. Artists should therefore be of help in the field of transportation graphics. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration is establishing a Task Force of experts from various fields to unify and lend direction to the forces of change in transportation graphics as they influence highways. The Task Force will move forward on the premise that the alliance of artist, scientist and technician can bring a new dimension to highway communication, built upon the more traditional skills of other specialists. /// L'auteur parle de la nécessité de trouver des moyens de renseigner et d'aider le voyageur, qui soient plus efficaces, plus rapides et plus attrayants. Il situe son sujet dans une perspective historique, et le relie à d'autres centres d'intérêt: l'art, la science et la technologie. Il y a longtemps que les artistes ont pris comme thème les voyageurs, que ces derniers empruntent leurs propres équipages ou des voitures de poste, de fins voiliers ou des bateaux à aubes, des automobiles ou les chemins de fer; ainsi que les paysages que ceux-ci découvraient le long des routes ou dans la montagne. L'auteur souligne l'influence que les artistes ont eue sur l'architecture, sur l'imprimerie et autres objets courants, et sur le profil des avions, des automobiles et des trains. Op Art, Pop Art et Art Cinétique sont des manifestations de l'intérêt que porte l'artiste contemporain aux divers aspects de la vie d'aujourd'hui.

Although invented by D. Gabor some twenty years ago, the real possibilities of the method have become more generally realized only recently, when lasers became available. The reason for this is that the success of holography depends to a large extent on the coherence of the light used. By utilizing coherent light from a laser, it is possible to store information about a three-dimensional object on a flat plate--the hologram. On a hologram an interference pattern is recorded. This pattern is produced by mixing the incident undisturbed laser light with laser light that has been scattered by different parts of an object. Information on the relative phase-shifts of the scattered waves is then transmitted from the object to the hologram and stored in the form of interference patterns on the developed plate. By illuminating the hologram only by an undisturbed laser beam, it is possible to reconstruct the original scattered waves. To an observer this means that he sees a three-dimensional object in exactly the same way as if the real object were present. Parallax effects are preserved and the observer also must change the focus of his eyes regarding different parts of the objects in the hologram. The technique thus provides a third dimension to a two-dimensional presentation. The same part of the image of the object can be seen in different parts of the hologram when viewed from different angles. This means that each small area of the hologram plate contains information about the whole object. A number of experiments, aiming at technical and scientific applications of holography are discussed. Some aspects of the impact of the field of holography on present day scientific research are mentioned, as well as future possibilities of the new technique. The question of how holography may be used by artists is left open. /// La possibilité d'utiliser dansles applications artistiques une nouvelle technique optique appelée holographie est signalée, et les principes fondamentaux de la méthode sont discutés. Bien que cette dernière ait été inventée il y a une vingtaine d'années par D. Gabor, ses véritables possibilités n'ont été reconnues sur un plan plus général que récemment, lors de l'avènement du laser. La raison en est que la réussite de l'holographie dépend dans une large mesure de la cohérence de la lumière employée. En recourant à la lumière cohérente d'un laser, il devient possible d'emmagasiner sur une surface plane, appelée hologramme, les informations relatives à un objet à trois dimensions. Sur l'hologramme est enregistré un schéma interférentiel obtenu en mélangeant la lumière laser incidente, non perturbée, avec une lumière laser qui a été préalablement dispersée par diverses parties de l'objet. L'information traduisant les déphasages relatifs des ondes dispersées est alors transmise de l'objet à l'hologramme pour y être emmagasinée, sur la surface plane développée, sous la forme de schémas interférentiels. En illuminant ensuite l'hologramme exclusivement à l'aide d'un faisceau laser non perturbé, il est possible de reconstituer les ondes dispersées initiales. Cela revient pour l'observateur à voir un objet à trois dimensions exactement comme si cet objet lui-même se trouvait là. Tout effet de parallaxe est exclu, ce qui oblige l'observateur à accommoder la distance focale de ses yeux lorsque il examine les diverses parties de l'image holographique. Grâce à la technique, on obtient ainsi l'adjonction de la troisième dimension à une représentation bidimensionnelle. La même partie de l'image peut être vue dans plusieurs parties différentes de l'hologramme si on fait varier l'angle d'observation. Cela revient à dire que chaque petite surface de l'hologramme contient les informations relatives à la totalité de l'objet. Un certain nombre d'expériences tendant à des applications techniques et scientifiques de l'holographie sont discutés. Certains aspects des répercussions qu'aura l'holographie sur la recherche scientifique moderne sont mentionnés, ainsi que les possibilités d'avenir de cette nouvelle technique. Le question de savoir comment l'holographie pourra être utilisée par les artistes est laissée pendante."

Hayter","Leonardo",1,"4",1968-10-01,"pp. 347-350","10.2307/1571983","The MIT Press","fla","","The artist gives an account of his process in making a painting to the extent of the factors of which he is conscious. He states that he believes that the most important factors will remain unknowable. He points out that he has some experience in the fields of physics and mathematics and with the general methods of scientific research. He has specially been interested in fluid motion and structure and wave motion in air and in water. He believes that an artist who cannot feel the difference, for example, between various wave shapes lacks a most valuable sensibility. The subject of his painting 'Transformations' was determined by his interest in various wave forms. The general plan of the painting is described. Before describing the process used in the making of the picture, he discusses the human preference for directions towards the right rather than to the left and from the top downwards rather than from the bottom upwards. By the use of these preferences or asymmetries he believes that a static painting can give an illusion of motion, provided that the eyes can be compelled to follow simultaneously two lines at different speeds. In the final section he describes in detail the seven steps which made up the process he used in making the painting. He concludes by stating that 'Transformations' might on the one hand transmit to an observer the relationship between the painting and various kinds of wave patterns in nature. On the other hand the painting might give the observer an understanding and experience of combinations and contrasts of wave forms in general. /// L'artiste explique le processus qu'il suit pour produire un tableau, et expose les facteurs qui l'y poussent, dans la mesure où il en est conscient. A son avis d'ailleurs, les impulsions les plus importantes lui resteront toujours inconnues. Il signale l'expérience qu'il possède en physique, en mathématiques, et dans le domaine de la recherche scientifique. Il s'est particulièrement intéressé à la dynamique des fluides, et à la structure et à la propagation des ondes dans l'air et dans l'eau. Il pense qu'un artiste, incapable de voir la différence qui existe par exemple entre différents schémas de propagation d'ondes, est dépourvu d'un genre de perception sensible de grande valeur. C'est dans l'intérêt porté par l'auteur à différents genres d'ondes qu'il faut trouver la source de ses tableaux 'Transformations'. Il décrit le plan général de ses peintures. Avant de passer à la description de son processus de production, il traite de la préférence ressentie par l'homme pour certaines directions: de gauche à droite, plutôt que le contraire. En faisant usage de ces préférences ou assymétries, l'auteur pense qu'un tableau statique peut donner une illusion de mouvement, dans la mesure où les yeux doivent suivre simultanément deux sortes de courbes à des vitesses différentes. Enfin, il détaille les sept étapes qu'il suit dans la création d'un tableau. Pour conclure, il explique que ses 'Transformations' pourraient faire saisir à un observateur les relations qui existent entre sa peinture et différents schémas ondulatoires naturels, et de plus donner à cet observateur la compréhension et l'expérience des combinaisons d'ondes et de leurs contrastes, de manière plus générale."

The author states that Moholy-Nagy and Buckminster Fuller influenced him greatly in his formative years. Later, he was influenced by the physical sciences, Zen philosophy, Taoism and Western thought. He believes that a work of art is the result of a process of induction. His works are in the nature of a 'happening', somewhat independent of his conscious will. Like the ancient Greeks, he believes in a muse that inspires the artist in his work. /// L'auteur parle de la production de ses sculptures en les étudiant de trois points de vue différents: (1) la recherche de matériaux appropriés et l'essai d'outils et de techniques qui puissent résoudre les problèmes posés par les exigences de la création d'une œuvre; (2) les influences principales qui ont aidé à former la base à partir de laquelle ses œuvres ont pu exister, telles que celles d'artistes, de savants et de penseurs qui ont stimulé son processus de formation en y contribuant; (3) le 'déroulement d'une œuvre', qui, comprenant l'exploration de l'espace sculptural, est considéré comme un processus en évolution. L'auteur déclare que Moholy-Nagy et Buckminster Fuller l'ont beaucoup influencé durant ses années de formation. Par la suite, il a subi l'influence des sciences naturelles et exactes, de la philosophie Zen, du Taoïsme et de la pensée occidentale. Il croit qu'une œuvre d'art est le résultat d'un processus d'induction. Ses œuvres sont de la même nature qu'un 'happening', indépendantes en quelque sorte de sa volonté consciente.

Eleven works are discussed. The first is 'Screw Mobile, 1965', which is fundamentally a programmed work. Three elements are used in its design--parabola, circle and vertical line. These are made in brass metal as bar, ring and rod. The work is an exploration of the complexity of the field of motion within a simple, screw-like rotation, which was realized through the medium of change. The eleven works are tabulated and are considered according to the nature of changes that take place. The circle can become either a continuous cylinder or a series of rings. The rod can be either central and used for suspension, or discarded, or returned again as a support or suspended as a screw thread around which activity can take place. The bar may cease to be parabolic and become straight. A square-section tunnel (compounded of a bar and a cylinder) is also included. In the penultimate work cited, the curved bar has a hyperbolic form. Notions of expressive universal and fundamental forms (such as cup, tunnel and box) enter in the work. A work is regarded as a play of interrelated, broken rhythms of position and dimension. Rhythm becomes a constructive force. A work is also considered as a structure of events. Interest in the possibilities of change in transformable works leads to an interest in the limitations to be used in their construction. In the study of processes of constructing, three kinds are given: (1) pre-designing, (2) predetermination of a system allowing for decision-making by the artist throughout the construction of a work and (3) work growing automatically out of the first act without previous planning. /// L'artiste étudie une série de ses œuvres afin de démontrer le rôle du changement dans l'élaboration d'une œuvre, et dans une suite d'œuvres. Le sujet traite aussi de l'activité en tant que produit fini. Onze œuvres sont examinées. La première est 'Screw Mobile, 1965', qui est fondamentalement une œuvre programmée. Trois éléments la composent: lapa rabole, le cercle et la ligne verticale. Ces éléments apparaissent sous forme de barre, d'anneau et de baguette en cuivre. Cette œuvre est une exploration de la complexité du champ en mouvement dans une rotation simple, comme celle d'une vis, exploration qui a été réalisée au moyen de changements de position. Les onze œuvres sont disposées et étudiées d'après la nature des changements qui peuvent intervenir. Le cercle peut devenir soit un cylindre, soit une série d'anneaux. La baguette peut avoir une position centrale et être utilisée comme moyen de suspension, ou être abandonnée puis reprise comme support, ou suspendue comme une vis autour de laquelle une activité peut se produire. La barre peut quitter sa forme parabolique et devenir droite. L'œuvre comprend aussi un tunnel de section carrée (composé d'une barre et d'un cylindre). Dans l'avant-dernière œuvre citée, la barre incurvée a une forme hyperbolique."

Après deux tapisseries exécutées pour Arnhem, Pays-Bas, d'après des dessins pré-existants, mis en couleurs pour l'occasion, l'auteur réalisa plusieurs cartons de tapis et de tapisseries dans les années qui suivirent. Pour les tapisseries, il suffit d'agrandir photographiquement les dessins originaux, alors que pour les tapis il convient d'établir des copies schématiques aux dimensions finales. Les couleurs sont choisies sur échantillons, en accord avec les tisserands. Certains ateliers de tissage, toutefois, ont fait preuve d'une certaine désinvolture dans la transposition des dessins originaux. Plus récemment, l'auteur a produit des dessins destinés à des tapisseries de grande taille. Dans ce cas, on agrandit photographiquement des bandes, qui, juxtaposées, formeront un carton aux dimensions de la tapisserie. Plusieurs mois sont nécessaires pour réaliser ces tapisseries. Les 'dessins à lacunes' ont trouvé une autre application en céramique. Avec l'aide d'un artisan spécialisé dans ce domaine, l'auteur réalisa le décor des deux plus grands vases jamais exécutés par la manufacture de Sèvres, décor sur le thème orphique. Cette expérience fut, depuis, renouvelée avec bonheur. /// In 1954 a statement made by a museum director led the author to transform some of his drawings with 'blank areas' (à lacunes) into tapestry cartoons, through the means of photographic enlargement. Two tapestries were made for Arnhem, Holland from previously made drawings, to which colours were added. Then, in the following years, the author made several drawings especially designed for cartoons for carpets and tapestries. As far as tapestries are concerned, the original drawings must be enlarged photographically; however for carpets, copies of the drawings of the same size as the carpets must be made. The colours are chosen from samples, in agreement with the weavers. Some tapestry makers, however, copied original drawings with an utter disregard of the artist's original drawings. More recently, the author has produced drawings intended for tapestries of large size. In this case, strips of the drawing are enlarged photographically and then placed side by side. It takes several months to complete one of these large tapestries. His drawings have also been applied to ceramic objects. With the help of a specialised craftsman, the author decorated the two tallest vases ever made by the famous Manufacture de Sèvres in France."

This state of the world is reflected in the artist and his art. The author found that oil painting was not suitable for communicating the heterogeneous aspects of reality which interested him. He was thus led to the use of the montage technique. He gives a short historical review of the evolution of collage and montage techniques, beginning with a Japanese collage of the tenth century. The artists who have had an influence on his work are mentioned. The montage technique of his own, which he calls montage-painting, is described in detail. He concludes his paper with the conviction that all theories of aesthetics, all colloquies on artistic problems can in the last resort be reduced to two basic questions: the connexion between art and life and the relation between form and content. He believes that most users of the techniques of montage and of collage today contradict the spirit of the techniques. For they have frequently degenerated into simple technical aids for achieving only a better organization of forms and colours, whereas their principal purpose is to express content. /// L'auteur montre que nous vivons à une époque où règnent les chocs, la destruction et le changement, des mutations terrifiantes et prometteuses à la fois, le désespoir et la confiance. Cet état du monde est reflété par l'artiste et par son art. L'auteur a trouvé que la peinture à l'huile n'était pas appropriée à la communication des aspects hétérogènes de la réalité qui l'intéressaient. C'est ainsi qu'il fut conduit à utiliser la technique du montage. Il donne un bref aperçu historique de l'évolution des techniques du collage et du montage, qui remontent à un papier collé japonais du Xè siècle. Il mentionne les artistes qui ont exercé une influence sur ses œuvres. Sa propre technique du montage, qu'il appelle montage-painting, est décrite en détail. Les différentes possibilités d'expression d'un contenu en connexion avec les techniques du montage sont démontrées. Il conclut son article en exprimant sa conviction que toutes les théories esthétiques, toutes les discussions sur les problèmes artistiques, peuvent finalement être ramenées à deux problèmes fondamentaux: la connexion entre l'art et la vie, et la relation entre la forme et le contenu. Le montage-painting est un moyen qui exclut la spécialisation et permet un art expérimental, simultané et compréhensible. L'auteur croit que la plupart de ceux qui utilisent les techniques du montage et du collage de nos jours, sont en contradiction avec l'esprit de ces techniques. Car elles se sont souvent abâtardies en devenant simplement un moyen d'aider à obtenir une meilleure organisation des formes et des couleurs, alors que leur but premier est d'exprimer un contenu."

Et pourtant le processus de la recherche, de la création, de l'exécution est passionnant à suivre. Au départ si les membres de l'équipe offrent divers visages: tour à tour musiciens, sculpteurs, poètes, metteurs en scène, la dynamique qui anime celle-ci est une: la recherche pour la création de sons et de formes. Une fois le son isolé, il est nécessaire de lui trouver une forme originale: 'l'objet-sculpture musical' sera soit un instrument de musique, soit un instrument simple pour jouer, soit un objet-sculpture dont le son alors intervient comme complément, soit enfin une forme en tant que point de départ à une technique de travail des matériaux. Là intervient le choix, le choix du moyen de communication pour que le message soit compréhensible tout en étant original. Tout leur travail est de découvrir une nouvelle expression musicale. Dans le contact avec le public, l'empirisme, là encore, est très enrichissant, notamment dans la branche d'activité des instruments de musique mis à sa disposition, une fois admis le principle que l'instinct ludique subsiste en tout homme. L'équipe attend beaucoup de cette participation du public à l'œuvre dans cette branche. Enfin, il faut mettre en lumière une deuxième dominante essentielle de l'œuvre des frères Baschet: après la recherche par l'expérience empirique, la recherche d'une harmonie. L'harmonie entre forme, son, sculpture, musique, lumière, poésie, mouvement. Mais une harmonie nouvelle, pour une génération nouvelle. /// If art and love are similar, art should be understandable without any explanation; the 'Sonorous Structures' made by the Baschet brothers should be understood without analysing their components, or the impulses of their creation. Nevertheless, their process of research, creation, execution is of interest. The members of the team possess several qualifications in the fields of music, sculpture, poetry and play production, however the leading idea of the team is research for creating sounds and shapes. Once a way of producing sound is found, appropriate shape is required for the device: the musical sculpture-object can be considered either as a musical instrument, as an instrument easy to play, as a sculpture-object for which sound is only complementary, or even as the starting point for working with materials. Then comes the problem of choosing the means of communication in such a way that a message is both understandable and original. All of the work of the team is directed towards the finding of a new musical expression. On the assumption that a playing instinct is possessed by everyone, members of an audience are invited to try their hand at playing these instruments. The work of the team is directed to a search for harmony, in the sense of harmony between shapes, sounds, sculpture, music, light, poetry and motion--a harmony for a new generation."
"10.2307/1571989","The New Musical Notation: A Graphic Art?","John Evarts","Leonardo",1,"4",1968-10-01,"pp. 405-412","10.2307/1571989","The MIT Press","fla","","Following the rupture with the past in the visual arts, contemporary music too has broken violently with tradition in the last 40 years. The palette of sound possibilities has been radically increased--including electronic sounds and noise--and with the new theories and techniques have come equally radical changes in musical notation. Some of the changes have been functional and essential, some have been extremist and exaggerated. The illustrations--the graphic pictures used as scores--show the extent of freedom and responsibility given to the performers and to chance. The resemblance of some of the scores to the work of painters of the last decades, such as Mondrian, Miro and Klee is striking. The new notation has aroused much dissent and opposition as well as support. Exhibitions have been given of 'graphic scores', numerous analytical articles have been written; publishers protest because of the greatly increased cost in beginning from scratch for each score; there is no standardization of indications for special effects; conductors and performers find the 'realization' of the scores extremely difficult and time-consuming. One writer, Karl Roschitz, clarifies the purpose of this new graphic notation in these terms: 'The essential condition of these ""optical transcriptions"", apart from questions of passing fashion, is the constant desire to find for the work to be performed and interpreted a method of fixation, so to speak, ""adapted to the material"" and which thereby gives the interpreter a clear, transparent and complete picture of the work as well as of the events and problems which are its ""key""... on these scores are indicated only the purely approximative musical ""evolutions and developments""--evolutions intended to make the performer himself discover and make felt the facets and relations of sound, of perpetually new sound events.' The writer poses the question of whether these graphic scores may not be regarded with more interest for their visual appeal in the future than for the music which they are intended to communicate. These experiments may stimulate and strengthen later creativeness: they reflect the desire to evolve new forms of expression and new tools of communication, and in the new notations, they reveal a kinship with the graphic artist which has never before existed so strongly. /// Après que les arts plastiques aient rompu avec le passé, la musique contemporaine, elle aussi, a violemment rompu avec la tradition, durant les quarante dernières années. La gamme des possibilités du son s'est considérablement étendue --y compris dans le domaine des sons et des bruits produits électroniquement, et, avec les théories et les techniques nouvelles, sont venus des changements aussi radicaux dans la notation musicale. Certains de ces changements ont été fonctionnels et essentiels, certains ont été trop extrémistes et exagérés. Les illustrations--c'est à dire les images graphiques utilisées comme partitions--montrent dans quelle mesure la liberté et la responsabilité sont laissées entre les mains des exécutants et du hasard. La ressemblance entre certaines des partitions et les œuvres des peintres des dernières décades, tels que Mondrian, Miro et Klee, est frappante. Cette nouvelle notation a suscité beaucoup de commentaires, les uns violemment opposés, les autres favorables. Des expositions de 'partitions graphiques' ont été organisées, de nombreux articles analytiques ont été écrits; les éditeurs protestent en raison du coût beaucoup plus élevé dans la production, à partir de zéro, de chaque partition; il n'existe aucun standard pour indiquer les effets spéciaux; les chefs d'orchestre et les exécutants trouvent la 'réalisation' des partitions extrêmement difficile et laborieuse. Un écrivian, Karl Roschitz, clarifie le but de cette nouvelle notation graphique, en ces termes: 'La condition essentielle de ces ""transcriptions optiques"", en dehors des questions de mode en évolution, est le constant désir de trouver, pour l'œuvre à exécuter et à interpréter, une méthode de fixation, en quelque sorte ""adaptée au matériel"", et qui par là donne à l'interprète une image claire, transparente et complète de l'œuvre, comme des évènements et des problèmes qui en sont la ""clef""...sur ces partitions sont uniquement indiqués les ""évolutions et développements"" musicaux, d'une manière purement approximative--ce qui a pour but de faire découvrir et ressentir à l'interprète même les facettes et les relations du son, des évènements d'un son perpetuellement renouvelé.' L'écrivain demande si ces partitions graphiques ne peuvent être regardées dans le futur avec un intérêt centré davantage sur leur attaction visuelle que sur la musique qu'elles sont censées produire. Ces expériences peuvent stimuler et renforcer la créativité par la suite: elles reflètent le désir d'élaborer de nouvelles formes d'expression et de nouveaux outils de communication, et, dans les nouvelles notations, elles révèlent une parenté avec l'art graphique qui n'a jamais existé auparavant de manière si forte."

He elucidates three new methods for the techniques of color drypoint, woodcut and chromatic wood sculpture. Prior to Borne's invention of pure color drypoint, the line processes played only an auxiliary role in the production of a color intaglio print. With his new technique for woodcuts, the inherent weakness of the traditional methods are corrected and new effects obtained. With the chromatic wood sculpture technique, the natural colors and textures of many thousands of varieties of hardwoods can be used in a method illustrating the author's basic artistic tenet--that art, like life and science, to be creative should be additive rather than reductive. /// A partir de sa longue carrière artistique, ainsi que des expériences scientifiques sur les problèmes de la perception réalisés à la New School for Social Research (Nouvelle Ecole pour la Recherche Scientifique) de New York, l'auteur expose les critères significatifs de l'innovation en matière d'art, ainsi que la contribution de la science à l'art. Il explique trois nouvelles méthodes pour les techniques de la pointe sèche colorée, de la gravure sur bois, et de la sculpture sur bois chromatiques. Avant qu'il n'invente la pointe sèche colorée pure, les lignes ne jouaient qu'un rôle secondaire dans la production d'une gravure en creux colorée. Grâce à sa nouvelle technique de gravure sur bois, les faiblesses des méthodes traditionnelles sont supprimées, et de nouveaux effets sont obtenus. Enfin, sa technique de sculpture sur bois chromatiques permet d'utiliser les couleurs et textures naturelles de plusieurs milliers de variétés de bois durs, de manière à illustrer le principe artistique de base de l'auteur, à savoir que, pour être créateur, l'art, tout comme la vie et la science, doit ajouter plutôt qu'enlever quelque chose."
"10.2307/1572017","L'abstrait et le reel","Jacques Mandelbrojt","Leonardo",2,"2",1969-04-01,"pp. 117-125","10.2307/1572017","The MIT Press","fla","","Dans cet article, qui n'expose pas une théorie à priori, mais une réflexion sur sa peinture, l'auteur présente un rapport nouveau entre la peinture abstraite et la peinture figurative. Partant de l'observation qu'un peintre ne peut connaître la réalité en soi, mais seulement la 'réalité en moi', c'est-à-dire les images mentales qu'il en a par l'intermédiaire des sensations, l'auteur affirme que le but de la peinture figurative est de représenter ces images mentales. La peinture abstraite est, par contre, la représentation des structures de l'esprit à l'état pur, et la réalité devient image mentale lorsqu'elle acquiert ces structures par l'intermédiaire des sensations. Si bien qu'une peinture n'est pleinement figurative, c'est-à-dire pleinement fidèle aux images mentales, que si elle a la structure de ces images, c'est-à-dire si elle est en même temps pleinement abstraite. La figuration est de l'abstraction incarnée. Il'indique une méthode basée sur ces réflexions pour 'extraire' la réalité de la peinture figurative: puisque l'abstraction est l'apport du peintre à la peinture, la réalité apparaîtra comme ce qui est commun aux peintures traitant un même thème avec diverses structures abstraites. Si au contraire on applique une même structure abstraite à des thèmes différents, on voit apparaître cette structure comme l'élément commun à ces peintures. La peinture figurative est donc clarifiée grâce à l'existence de la peinture abstraite. Inversement la peinture abstraite s'enrichit par l'effort qui consiste à chercher la structure abstraite la mieux adaptée à un thème donné. La peinture gestuelle joue un rôle particulier: elle clarifie la manière dont les images mentales et musculaires deviennent peinture. Il termine en donnant un 'dictionnaire' des structures abstraites, qui illustre les considérations précédentes. /// In this article, which is not an a priori theory, but a reflection on the author's paintings, a new relationship between abstract and figurative painting is put forward. Starting from the fact that a painter never can know reality itself, but only the mental and muscular images he has of reality through sensations, he states that figurative painting consists in the representation of these mental images. Abstract painting is the representation of the structures of the mind, and reality becomes a mental image by acquiring these structures through sensation. Thus, to be fully figurative, that is, to be a faithful representation of mental images, a painting must have the structure of these images, which means that it must be, at the same time, fully abstract. A method based upon this analysis is given to extract pure reality from a figurative painting: abstraction being the element which is brought to the painting by the eye, mind and hand of the painter, reality itself appears when one compares paintings representing the same subject with different abstract structures, it is the component which these paintings have in common. Conversely, by varying the themes to which the same abstract structure is applied, one obtains the structure itself. This method is analogous to our modern understanding of the universe, such a series of paintings is thus a metaphor of our modern philosophy, just as the paintings in the middle ages were a metaphor of theology. Reality can thus be crystallized in a pure state through the existence of abstract painting. Conversely, abstraction is being enriched when one seeks the abstract structure best adapted to a given subject matter. The particular role of action painting in clarifying the way in which mental or muscular images become paintings is also analysed. All these considerations are exemplified with a short 'dictionary' of abstract structures."

It is in the tools and their manipulation that the source of new expression in painting will be found. He reviews the use of the brush during the past and the introduction of the spatula or pallet knife as a 'painting' tool by artists in the nineteenth century. He next considers the physical aspect of making a 'classical' type painting and makes a comparison with the greater utilization of the capacities of the human body by the instrumental musicians. He asks whether in the art of painting a way can be found to involve to a greater extent man in his totality. He believes that this 'totality' can be approached through the greater mobilization of the body's resources and the invention of new tools. He gives as examples ten methods of producing a 'painting' ranging from simultaneous ambidextrous brush manipulation to the transfer of paint to a canvas with the tires of an automobile driven by the 'painter'. The results he has obtained with some of these methods are shown in the article. In an appendix some observations by the author illustrate the tribulations of an outdoor 'painter' using unorthodox techniques of painting. /// L'auteur pense que l'avenir de la peinture ne réside plus dans l'affrontement entre la peinture abstraite et la peinture figurative, et qu'une nouvelle période s'élabore pour une redéfinition de la peinture. Les sources d'une expression nouvelle de la peinture seront trouvées par les instruments et leur utilisation. Il rapelle l'utilisation du pinceau dans le passé et l'introduction par les artistes du dix-neufième siécle de la spatule ou couteau à pallette comme instrument de peinture. Il considère ensuite les positions de l'artiste réalisant des peintures dites de 'types classiques' et établit une comparaison avec les musiciens instrumentistes utilisant davantage les ressources du corps humain. D'ailleurs il se demande si la peinture n'offre pas pour l'homme une plus grande possibilité de se réaliser dans sa totalité. Il pense que cette totalité peut être recherchée à travers une plus grande mobilisation des ressources du corps humain, et par l'invention de nouveaux outils. Il donne comme exemples dix méthodes pour exécuter une peinture allant de l'utilisation simultanée des deux mains au transport de la peinture sur une toile par les pneux d'une automobile conduite par le peintre. Les résultats qu'il a obtenus avec quelques-unes de ces méthodes sont relatées dans l'article. En appendice, quatre petites histoires racontées par l'auteur lui-même illustrent les tribulations d'un peintre d'extérieur des techniques de peinture peu orthodoxes."
"10.2307/1572019","The Cubic Element in My Sculpture","Jacques Schnier","Leonardo",2,"2",1969-04-01,"pp. 135-145","10.2307/1572019","The MIT Press","fla","","The use of commonly familiar representational subject matter in the exploration and invention of new sculpture has been practically if not entirely exhausted. In first making the change from figurative to non-figurative presentations in his sculpture, the artist limits himself to the use of cubic-like geometric volumes. This not only helps him to completely relinquish any figurative suggestions in his work but aids him to concentrate on the problem of simple forms. Influenced by his previous engineering--architectural training and experience, he organizes the cubic volumes of his initial compositions on a horizontal--vertical format. From this format he moves to one in which the axes of all volumes are at angles with the vertical and the horizontal and, further, explores the inverted pyramid type image. Through all these compositions he integrates the volumes by means of an interlocking and overlapping treatment. In this way he avoids the mere juxtaposition or piling of shapes one on top of the other like children's building blocks. Cubic-like shapes are ideally suited for exploring new sculpture arrangements. In the first place, they afford an artist a ready means for establishing volume or mass in his compositions. Secondly, the planes and edges of these geometrical masses, through their infinite positioning possibilities, enable him to readily achieve variety and feeling of movement in his sculptural forms. /// L'utilisation de la représentation figurative dans de nouvelles formes de sculpture est une source d'inspiration tarie, car les possibilités qu'elle offre sont pratiquement épuisées. Quand, dans ses compositions sculpturales, l'auteur passe d'une représentation figurative à une représentation abstraite, il se limite à l'utilisation de volumes géométriques de forme cubique. Cela lui permet d'écarter complètement toute suggestion d'ordre figuratif, et, de plus, de se concentrer plus fortement sur le problème de la forme pure. Subissant l'influence de son expérience d'ingénieur et d'architecte, il organisa les volumes cubiques de ses premières œuvres sur un double plan horizontal et vertical. Puis, il évolua vers un schéma dans lequel les axes de tous les volumes forment des angles avec la verticale et l'horizontale, et enfin il explora le schéma de la pyramide inversée. Quel que soit le modèle suivi, il réunit les volumes en les emboîtant les uns aux autres ou en les faisant chevaucher. Il évite ainsi de simplement les juxtaposer ou de les empiler comme les jeux de cubes des enfants. Les formes cubiques conviennent parfaitement pour la découverte de nouvelles structures sculpturales. Tout d'abord, elles fournissent à l'artiste des moyens faciles d'établir les volumes ou les masses de ses compositions. De plus, grâce aux innombrables variétés de positions qu'ils offrent, les plans et les angles formés par ces masses géométriques lui permettent d'atteindre aisément une grande diversité et une sensation de mouvement dans ses œuvres."

Draper","Leonardo",2,"2",1969-04-01,"pp. 147-153","10.2307/1572020","The MIT Press","fla","","The author describes what modern technology involves and the personal qualifications needed to provide the necessary leadership for achieving the social objectives of this kind of complex human activity. He points out the differences between basic and applied science, engineering and technology. He notes that engineers, who might be expected to develop into leaders of technology, are, on the whole, failing to do so in the United States today. In order to clarify the relationships between the various elements of technology, a diagram is presented showing the interconnections between the elements, both as regards the social and physical environment and their own special character. The author is of the view that at the present time American institutions of higher education are devoting too much attention to the training of basic and applied scientists, and neglecting the development of adequately qualified engineers and technologists. He does not mean to imply that a broad background in science, mathematics and the humanities is not essential, for it is required by modern engineering and technology. He finds that proven men of action in technology have given little thought to measures for improving the situation, mainly because they are too busy with their own projects. They have resigned this responsibility to teachers and researchers in basic and applied sciences who, having both time and enthusiasm, proceed to crowd out engineering subjects rather than improve them to match the requirements of rapidly changing technology. He recommends that institutions for producing professional engineers and technologists be planned and established along current academic lines except for an increased emphasis on the preparation of students for real-world practice as is done, for example, by faculties of law and medicine. In conclusion, the author cites his experience of some thirty years in directing the Instrumentation Laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which he believes would be effective as one model of such institutions. /// L'auteur expose les implications de la technologie moderne, et explique quelles personnes sont nécessaires pour encadrer la réalisation des objectifs sociaux de cette sorte d'activité humaine particulièrement complexe. Il souligne les différences qui existent entre les sciences fondamentales et les sciences appliquées, entre l''engineering' et la technologie. Il remarque que les ingénieurs, qui devraient devenir les cadres de la technologie, n'arrivent pas, dans l'ensemble, à remplir actuellement cette mission aux Etats Unis. Afin de jeter quelque lumière sur les rapports qui existent entre les divers éléments de la technologie, l'auteur présente un diagramme qui montre les interconnexions entre ces éléments, sur le double plan de leur environnement social et physique, et de leurs caractéristiques propres. L'auteur pense qu'actuellement en Amérique, les institutions qui dispensent une éducation supérieure insistent trop sur la formation de savants, et pas assez sur celle de techniciens et d'ingénieurs véritablement qualifiés. Cela ne veut pas dire qu'une large culture générale en sciences, en mathématiques et en sciences humaines n'est pas essentielle, car elle est nécessaire pour la technologie et l''engineering' modernes. Il trouve aussi que des hommes qui se sont révélés hommes d'action en technologie se sont peu consacres aux réformes à faire pour améliorer la situation, et ce, en grande partie parce qu'ils sont trop occupés par leurs propres projets. Ils ont abdiqué cette responsabilité en faveur des professeurs et des chercheurs en sciences fondamentales et appliquées, qui, ayant le temps et l'enthousiasme nécessaires, continuent à ne pas faire de place à l''engineering', au lieu de faire en sorte qu'il réponde aux exigences d'une technologie en évolution rapide. L'auteur recommande la création d'établissements spécialisés dans la formation de techniciens et d'ingénieurs professionnels, établissements qui seraient réalisés sur des bases académiques normales, en insistant toutefois sur la préparation des étudiants à la pratique effective de la technologie, comme c'est le cas par exemple dans les facultés de droit et de médecine. Pour conclure, l'auteur décrit son expérience en tant que directeur de l'Instrumentation Laboratory au Massachusetts Institute of Technology, établissement qui devrait à son avis servir d'exemple aux autres institutions de ce genre."
"10.2307/1572021","The Failure of Basic Design","Peter Lloyd Jones","Leonardo",2,"2",1969-04-01,"pp. 155-160","10.2307/1572021","The MIT Press","fla","","The article criticizes the role of the educational method called 'Basic Design' as it operates in the present art school system. 'Basic Design' is the modern English--American version of the Bauhaus 'Vorkurs' (Foundation Course). Its theoretical justification lies in the theory of 'design elements' derived from the aesthetic ideas of Bauhaus teachers such as Itten, Moholy-Nagy, Kandinsky and Klee. The author does not consider these ideas historically but criticizes the theory of the elements of design on logical grounds and denies its claim to provide a 'grammar of design'. He then shows that although they purport to be stylistically neutral, 'Basic Design' courses do contain hidden constraints which derive from the theory of 'elements' of design. These favour a certain type of aesthetic ordering with a small number of sharply separated subsystems. This sophisticated type of formal construction is contrasted with the type of art produced by school children just prior to their entry on the Foundation Course. Such artworks characteristically contain large numbers of interacting subsystems with cruder discriminations within these subsystems. The abrupt change from this type of ordering to the 'Bauhaus' type of construction seems to the author to present students with considerable problems of psychological adjustment. /// Cet article critique le rôle de la méthode d'éducation connue sous le nom de 'design' élémentaire ou 'basic design' telle qu'on l'applique actuellement dans les écoles d'art. Le 'design' élémentaire est l'équivalent moderne anglo-saxon du 'Vorkurs' ou semestre propédeutique à l'école du Bauhaus. Sa justification réside dans la théorie des 'formes élémentaires' dérivée des idées esthétiques des professeurs du Bauhaus, Itten, Moholy-Nagy, Kandinsky et Klee. L'auteur n'étudie pas ces idées sur un plan historique, mais critique la théorie des formes élémentaires sur la base de la logique, et réfute qu'elle fournisse une 'grammaire des formes de base'. Il montre ensuite que, tout en prétendant à une neutralité de style, les cours de 'Basic Design' contiennent en fait des contraintes cachées qui proviennent de la théorie des 'éléments' du dessin. Ces éléments favorisent un certain type d'agencement esthétique avec un petit nombre de sous-systèmes nettement séparés. Ce genre sophistiqué de construction formelle contraste avec ce que produisent les lycéens avant leur entrée au 'cours supérieur' (Foundation Course). Ces œuvres d'art sont caractérisées par un grand nombre de sous-systèmes qui réagissent entre eux, avec des discriminations très nettes entre ces sous-systèmes. De l'avis de l'auteur, le passage brutal de ce genre d'agencement à celui du Bauhaus est donc pour les étudiants une source des problèmes psychologiques d'adaptation."

"10.2307/1572047","My Plexiglas and Light Sculptures","Jim Hill","Leonardo",3,"1",1970-01-01,"pp. 9-17","10.2307/1572047","The MIT Press","fla","","The author describes his search for a delicate balance between emotional expressiveness and intellectual content in art in order to achieve a style which is both personal and meaningful to society. He mentions briefly his experience in making computer drawings. He describes in detail his use of modern materials and of electrical techniques to make light sculptures that give a sense of mystery. He believes his light sculptures produce enigmatic moods and talismanic references. They are balanced by his use of mathematical proportion for the plastic shapes inside a box and by modern methods of construction. The simplicity of the shapes chosen contrasts with the effects of flashing lights on Plexiglas in the interior of the box. The random cycles of flashing lights is produced by the use of thermal interrupters. He plans in the future to introduce greater control of light sequences to contrast with the random cycles. Eventually he intends to use lights controlled by electronic circuits instead of thermal interrupters to mystify the viewer even further. /// L'auteur décrit sa recherche d'un équilibre sensible dans l'art entre l'expression émotionnelle et la satisfaction intellectuelle, dans le but de parfaire un style qui soit à la fois personnel et compréhensible par les autres. Il mentionne brièvement ses expériences de production de dessins par des ordinateurs. Il décrit de manière détaillée comment il se sert des matériaux modernes et des techniques de l'électricité pour faire des sculptures lumineuses qui donnent une impression de mystère. A son avis, ses sculptures lumineuses provoquent des humeurs énigmatiques et des références talismaniques, qui sont équilibrées par l'utilisation de proportions mathématiques pour les formes de plastiques à l'intérieur d'une boîte et par des méthodes de construction modernes. La simplicité des formes choisies contraste avec les effets de traits de lumière sur le Plexiglas à l'intérieur de la boîte. Les cycles aléatoires de jets de lumière sont obtenus grâce à des interrupteurs thermiques. L'auteur projette d'introduire un plus grand contrôle des séquences lumineuses pour faire contraste avec les cycles aléatoires.

"10.2307/1572048","On Mental Images and Their Pictorial Representation","Jacques Mandelbrojt","Leonardo",3,"1",1970-01-01,"pp. 19-26","10.2307/1572048","The MIT Press","fla","","The author believes that painters in different epochs, without necessarily being fully aware of the fact, have represented in paintings their mental images of reality. He describes characteristics of paintings and compares them to mental images that have been studied by psychologists. He shows, in particular, how sketches are a more faithful representation of mental images than 'finished' paintings. He also points out that the often indefinite quality and the absence of detail in sketches correspond more closely to perception and imagination. From the psychology of perception it is known that a person fixes his gaze on only certain portions of an object at the moment he perceives it and that details of an object cannot be grasped in one's imagination. In their sketches painters rediscover the pristine human element that lies beyond the attitudes and prejudices of their era. Scientific reasoning is generally accompanied and supported by mental images. The author shows how the composition of the 'Adoration of the Magi' by Leonardo da Vinci corresponds to this type of image. He discusses characteristics of colors and of composition in paintings that represent mental images. He finds that the colors of a mental image of an object are independent of the real object. The importance of gesture in sketches is considered from the point of view that mental images have at the same time a kinesthetic property. Finally, the author attempts to determine the criteria for deciding whether a painting is based on sensation, memory or imagination. He gives the results of his own subjective studies and an analysis of paintings he has made from nature. /// L'auteur de cet article affirme que des peintures de diverses époques ont eu pour but plus ou moins conscient la représentation des images mentales que les peintres avaient de la réalité. Il décrit certaines propriétés de ces peintures et les compare avec des propriétés des images mentales telles qu'elles ont été mises en évidence par les psychologues. L'auteur montre notamment combien les esquisses sont une représentation plus fidèle des images mentales que ne le sont des peintures habituellement considérées comme plus achevées. En particulier, le caractère parfois clairsemé et l'absence de détails des esquisses correspondent à des propriétés de la perception et de l'imagination. Il est en effet reconnu que le regard ne fixe que certains points d'un objet lors de la perception, et que les détails d'un objet que l'on imagine sont insaisissables. Dans l'esquisse les peintres retrouvent l'humain au-delà des préjugés de chaque époque. Les raisonnements scientifiques sont accompagnés d'images qui leur servent de support. L'auteur montre comment la composition de 'l'Adoration des Mages' de Léonard de Vinci correspond à une telle image. Il étudie également la signification de l'œuvre de Marcel Duchamp. L'auteur met également en évidence certaines propriétés des couleurs et du dessin des peintures qui représentent des images mentales. La coloration de l'image mentale d'un objet est indépendante de celle de cet objet. L'importance du geste dans les esquisses est mise en rapport avec le fait que les images mentales sont plus encore kinesthétiques que mentales. Enfin, l'auteur cherche les caractères qui peuvent distinguer les peintures suivant qu'elles sont faites d'après la sensation, de mémoire ou d'imagination. Il donne en exemple notamment des reportages subjectifs qu'il a réalisés ainsi que ses peintures faites face à la nature."
"10.2307/1572049","On the Rhetoric of Vision","Stanley Meltzoff","Leonardo",3,"1",1970-01-01,"pp. 27-38","10.2307/1572049","The MIT Press","fla","","In all visual forms which carry meaning, from architecture to painting, the author points out that there is a level of organization which is rhetorical. The whole meaning of a work of art is the sphere of iconology. The study of its forms without regard to symbolic or other meaning is formal analysis. The area between, where the lesser forms of organization of meaning occur, is the area of visual rhetoric. Rhetoric is used in its classical, verbal sense as the means by which words are chosen, pitched to some diction, pointed with gestures and expression, and arrayed in order to affect a listener towards some end. Visual rhetoric overlaps verbal rhetoric when the material it orders translates easily from words to images and back, as in Renaissance and Baroque painting done under the motto 'ut pictura poesis'. By far the largest part of visual rhetoric has no verbal analogues and is, in fact, the discovery of the non-literary art of our time. The author states that the concept of the rhetoric of vision puts into a coherent system our ideas of style, genres, modes of representation, iconography, media, personal manner, format, composition and the negation of all or any of these. Visual rhetoric is the Iconography of the twentieth century. /// L'auteur montre que, dans toutes les formes plastiques porteuses de signification, de l'architecture à la peinture, il existe un niveau d'organisation rhétorique de cette signification. La signification globale d'une œuvre d'art est du domaine de l'iconologie; alors que de procéder à une étude des formes qu'elle présente sans la relier à une signification symbolique ou autre revient à faire une analyse formelle. C'est entre ces deux points de vue, là où se manifestent les formes inférieures d'organisation de la signification, que se place le domaine de la rhétorique visuelle. 'Rhétorique' est ici employé dans son sens les plus classique et verbal, comme le moyen de choisir des mots, de les adapter à un style, de les mettre en relief grâce à des gestes ou à des expressions, et de les arranger de façon à produire un certain effet sur l'auditeur. La rhétorique visuelle dépasse la rhétorique verbale lorsque ce qu'elle ordonnance passe facilement des mots aux images et vice versa, comme c'est le cas de la peinture de la Renaissance et de l'époque Baroque qui suivirent la devise 'ut pictura poesis'. En grande partie, il n'est rien de comparable à la rhétorique visuelle, laquelle consiste, de fait, en la découverte de l'art non-littéraire de notre époque. L'auteur pense que le concept de la rhétorique de la vision permet de rassembler dans un système cohérent nos idées de style, genres, modes de représentation, iconographie, moyens, manière personnelle, format, composition, ainsi que la négation de tout ou partie de ces éléments. La rhétorique visuelle est l'iconographie du vingtième siècle."

Il a fait au cours de sa carrière professionnelle des découvertes d'ordre esthétique qu'il a été heureux de faire connaître à ses semblables il y a plus de dix ans dans un article, qu'avec bravade il avait intitulé 'L'art abstrait est toujours figuratif'. Sa thèse--qui n'est plus nouvelle aujourd'hui--était que toutes les formes, mêmes les plus géométriques, se trouvent dans la nature et qu'il est possible de réaliser, d'après des motifs observés dans le monde microscopique, des tableaux qui pourraient passer pour abstraits. Il ne confond toutefois pas l'œuvre du peintre et son motif, l'artiste apportant naturellement toujours quelque chose de lui-même quand il a une personnalité. Enfin l'auteur donne quelques indications sur les techniques de coloration employées en métallurgie et apporte de nouveaux exemples de micrographies révélant les beautés cachées de la nature. /// The author, until recently director of the Institut de Recherches de la Sidérurgie Française, is a sculptor and a painter. During the course of his career, he made discoveries in the field of aesthetics which he published more than ten years ago in an article paradoxically entitled 'Abstract Art is Always Figurative'. His thesis, which is no longer new, stipulated that all forms, even the most geometrical ones, can be found in nature and that it is possible to produce abstract paintings based on patterns observed in the microscopic world. However, he does not confuse the work of a painter with its content, since the artist always brings to his work something of himself, if he is a person of originality. The author gives information on colouring techniques used in metallurgy and shows new examples of micrographs which reveal the concealed beauty of nature."

But it differs also since 'art is me--science is us'. New means of investigation with the electron microscope and X-rays enable one to explore invisible aspects of nature and to discover unsuspected forms of beauty which might be, and often are, subjects of inspiration to artists. Some examples are given in the article. It is particularly interesting to compare hidden forms, revealed to us by the most advanced instruments, with the creations of non-figurative artists. The comparison sometimes brings out surprising convergences between scientific photography and the products of painters and architects. The convergences are often found in works of art earlier than in scientific photographs relating to matter, as if the artist found within himself, in his projection on canvas, the forms nature reveals when examined in the finest detail. The author asks what could be the origin of the convergence: chance, knowledge of the progress in science or intuitive discovery of forms that reflect an aesthetic sense based on principles of efficiency and balance, as if there were in the artist a kind of subconscious foreknowledge enabling him to divine the architecture and harmony of matter? The question is an open one. /// La recherche scientifique s'apparente par bien des côtés à l'art, en ce sens qu'elle fait appel comme lui au sentiment esthétique: mais elle en diffère aussi car 'l'art c'est moi--la science, c'est nous'. Les nouveaux moyens d'investigation comme le microscope électronique et les rayons-X permettent d'explorer des régions invisibles et d'y découvrir des formes insoupçonnées et souvent d'une beauté, qui pourraient être--et qui sont parfois--des sujets d'inspiration pour l'artiste. Quelques exemples sont donnés dans cet article. Il est particulièrement intéressant de comparer ces formes cachées, dévoilées par les instruments les plus perfectionnés, avec les créations de nombreux artistes nonfiguratifs. Cette comparaison fait apparaître parfois des convergences étonnantes entre la photographie scientifique et la production du peintre ou de l'architecte; ces convergences sont souvent observées dans des œuvres artistiques antérieures à la découverte des récents moyens d'investigation de la matière, comme si l'artiste découvrait en lui, dans sa projection sur la toile, les formes offertes par la nature lorsqu'on l'examine dans ses plus fins détails. Quelle est l'origine de cette convergence? Hasard, connaissance des progrès de la science, ou découverte intuitive de formes qui correspondent à un sentiment esthétique basé sur un principe d'efficience et d'équilibre, comme s'il y avait dans l'artiste une sorte de prescience subconsciente qui lui fait deviner l'architecture et l'harmonie de la matière?

Davis","Leonardo",3,"2",1970-04-01,"pp. 139-147","10.2307/1572078","The MIT Press","fla","","It is the contention of the author that there are numerous limitations imposed by convention on verbal conversation that could be avoided if the participants were as concerned with contributions other than their own. Joint drawings are approached as a vehicle of dialogue and considered as a contribution to human understanding. The ideas in the article resulted from a series of drawings done jointly by the author and his wife. As a process, 'conversational' drawings represent an avenue for freeing the individual from the concept of 'inner necessity' so prevalent in the art of our century. The author also considers some of the assumptions upon which rest the idea of the supremacy of the 'art object'. The drawings tend to involve organic imagery and form relationships, and do not give an illusion of three dimensions. The 'conversational' aspects within the drawings are described as an 'internal' type of space, which is not content oriented and which reflects the tracing of visual paths mutually experienced by the participants. /// De l'avis de l'auteur, les convenances imposent de nombreuses limitations à la conversation verbale, limitations qui pourraient être évitées si chaque participant apportait autant d'intérêt à la contribution des autres qu'à la sienne propre. Des dessins faits en commun peuvent être compris comme étant porteurs de dialogue, et contribuent donc à la compréhension réciproque des êtres humains. Les idées directrices de cet article résultent d'une série de dessins réalisés conjointement par l'auteur et par son épouse. En tant que processus, les 'dessins conversationnels' sont un moyen de libérer l'individu du concept de 'nécessité interne' qui prévaut dans l'art du vingtième siècle. L'auteur discute également certaines des théories sur lesquelles repose l'idée d'une suprématie de l'objet d'art. Ces dessins tendent à inclure une imagerie organique, établissent des relations et ne donnent pas l'illusion de dessins à trois dimensions. L'auteur décrit les aspects 'conversationnels' des dessins comme un type d'espace 'interne' dont le sujet n'est pas l'élément principal, et qui reflète, en les esquissant, les expériences visuelles par lesquelles passent les participants."

He does not believe that any painting can be finished. A complex labyrinthian painted structure may provide a basis for polymorphism in painting, which, in his case is intended to lead to a metaphysical or sacred comprehension of the world. He discusses examples of labyrinths he has made. He believes that the development of continuously unfinished paintings may make fixed or frozen pictorial statements obsolete. He discusses the idea of a center being a Seventh Direction of Space, which, in the case of a labyrinth, is the viewer, himself. Further, he states that his labyrinths proclaim an acknowledgment of the extraordinary, the mysterious and the supernatural, as they present themselves in the etymological vocabulary of visual language. /// L'auteur énonce que la nature polymorphique d'un tableau prend fin brusquement lorsque l'artiste considère que son œuvre est terminée. Il ne croit pas d'ailleurs qu'une peinture soit jamais achevée. Une structure peinte complexe de type labyrinthe peut fournir une base au polymorphisme en peinture, ce qui, dans le cas de l'auteur, doit conduire à une compréhension du monde métaphysique ou sacrée. Il expose et discutes des exemples de certains de ses labyrinthes. A son avis, le développement de tableaux continuellement inachevés peut rendre désuets le témoignages picturaux fixes ou figés. Il discute ensuite l'idée d'un centre qui serait une Septième Direction de l'Espace représentée, dans le cas du labyrinthe, par le spectateur lui-même.

Il en rappelle les caractères déjà établis: origine visuelle, séjour dans l'inconscient, transformations et prolongements éventuels, et retour à la conscience sous forme d'images extra-rétiniennes. C'est là un phénomène très courant, mais souvent inobservé, très précieux pour le peintre par sa double valeur métaphysique et formelle. Il ne garantit d'ailleurs aucun résultat. L'auteur montre que ces images émanent, par sélection, de toute notre vie intérieure, dont elles nous révèlent un aspect, ce qui les fonde et les limite. Il décrit différents cas d'apparitions spontanées, y compris celui des hallucinogènes, qui lui parait sans intérêt pour l'artiste. Il étudie sur des exemples comment la vision conduit progressivement à la peinture, et quel enrichissement on peut en attendre. Il examine la cas de l'automatisme et de rencontres occasionnelles avec des visions. Enfin il souligne que la vision intérieure est une forme et une réalité, ce qui est un appui très précieux pour le peintre, et confère à l'œuvre, dans l'évocation de la vie intérieure, un pouvoir particulier de conviction. /// Stemming from a study he published in 1957, the author considers the problem of interior vision in pictorial creation in the light of his recent experiments and observations. He recalls characteristics he previously established: ocular origin, sojourn in the unconscious, transformations and possible extensions, and return to consciousness in the form of extra-retinal images. Interior vision is a very common phenomenon but it has not often been noted, although, it is very important to the painter from two points of view: metaphysical and formal. Of course it does not guarantee results. The author explains that interior visions emanate, through selection, from our inner experience, thus revealing one of their aspects and giving them both a foundation and a limit. He describes several cases of spontaneous apparitions including those provided by hallucinogens, and the latter are, in his opinion, of no interest to the artist. He gives examples of how interior visions of an artist may gradually enter into the creation of a painting and the enrichment one can expect from them. Cases of automatism and of occasional interior vision are examined. Lastly, he points out that interior vision has both form and reality, therefore, it is a very valuable aid to the painter. It brings to a work a particular power of conviction in evoking inner experience."

A cet égard, la collaboration entre l'artiste et le marchand de couleurs est précieuse. Les enduits traditionnels ont été remplacés par le gesso vinylique ou acrylique. Des peintures fabriquées avec ces mêmes matières plastiques sont maintenant à disposition des artistes sous une forme pratique. L'auteur donne des exemples de ces mouveaux matériaux produits par différentes firmes, et expose leurs propriétés, leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients. Une évolution a eu également lieu dans le domaine des matériaux utilisés par les sculpteurs, avec la découverte des stratifiés, du 'polybéton', de la mousse de polyuréthane, du polystyrène expansé, et des matières plastiques transparentes, translucides ou colorées qui existent sous plusieurs formes et sont fabriquées à l'aide d'acétate de cellulose et de méthacrylate de méthyle. /// The author explains that, whereas supports of paintings have not undergone much development, the same does not hold true for paints. He points out that co-operation between artists and manufacturers of art materials is of great value. The traditional grounds have been replaced by vinylic or acrylic gesso and paints made of these plastic materials are now also available in convenient form. The author gives examples of these new materials manufactured by various firms and discusses their properties, advantages and disadvantages. New materials for sculptors have also been developed, such as laminates, 'polybeton' polyurethane and polystyrene foams and transparent, translucid and coloured plastic materials in many forms made of cellulose acetate and methyl methacrylate."
"10.2307/1572082","For a Change in the Education of Artists","Barron M. Hirsch","Leonardo",3,"2",1970-04-01,"pp. 173-176","10.2307/1572082","The MIT Press","fla","","The author feels that a change in the traditional program for educating artists is necessary. He defines art as ideas expressed visually and believes the role of the artist is to influence many things that man makes. The personality of artists today is examined as well as those characteristics that an art education should emphasize. The author feels that a teaching program should extend experiences, provide for involvement, allow considerable freedom in the selection of study, encourage exposure to many different subjects and ideas, and promote a wide variety of individual art accomplishment. The present curriculum in the United States, the author believes, has been unsuccessful in accomplishing these goals. He suggests a new four-year curriculum to hopefully correct the deficiencies of present programs. The first year would provide a foundation in broad liberal studies together with a background in studio work. For the second and third years the student would work in different foreign countries to provide social and cultural involvement. The final year would be an independent tutorial with the student working in his own studio. The program would culminate with an exhibition of the student's work and a thesis concerning his development. /// L'auteur pense qu'un changement dans le programme traditionnel d'éducation des artistes s'avère nécessaire. Pour lui, l'art se définit comme des idées exprimées de manière visuelle, et l'artiste a pour rôle de faire porter son influence sur des choses produites par l'homme. L'auteur traite de la personnalité des artistes actuellement, ainsi que des caractéristiques sur lesquelles l'éducation artistique devrait mettre l'accent. Il pense que l'enseignement devrait accroître les champs d'expérience, permettre aux artistes de s'engager, fournir une grande liberté dans le choix des sujets étudiés, encourager la diversité des matières et des idées et promouvoir une grande variété d'accomplissement personnel dans l'art. De l'avis de l'auteur, le programme actuellement en vigueur aux Etats Unis n'a pas réussi à atteindre ces buts. Il suggère donc un nouveau programme s'étendant sur quatre ans et qui, du moins l'espère-t-il, corrigera les déficiences de l'actuel. La première année fournirait une large base d'études libérales, ainsi que les éléments principaux du travail d'atelier. Pendant les deux années suivantes, les étudiants travailleraient dans différents pays étrangers pour accroître leur engagement social et culturel. La dernière année consisterait en leçons particulières, l'étudiant travaillant dans son propre atelier. Le programme s'achèverait par une exposition des œuvres de l'étudiant et par une thèse décrivant son évolution."

He points out that he is also concerned with the influence art exerts on our environment and on people's rest and recreation. He presents data on the number of galleries, exhibitions and visitors in Czechoslovakia in the 1960's. To stimulate artistic activity, the Czechoslovak government has established Funds of the Plastic Arts in the Czech regions and in Slovakia. The Funds receive income in the form of a percentage on the fixed prices paid to artists for their works and contributions from the users of art. They offer for sale only works selected by a jury which has the responsibility to judge them from an artistic point of view and to set prices for them. The selling price consists of the fixed price received by an artist for a work plus 25 per cent surcharge to cover overhead expenses connected with sales. The Funds sell works to any interested party, i.e. to organizations and institutions and to private individuals. Data is presented indicating that purchases by private individuals is increasing steadily. The author discusses one of the problems of the economics of art--the determination of the value of a work and its price. The price an artist receives for his work does not necessarily represent an adequate estimate of its cultural value, especially as regards its possible value in the future. The possibility of buyers making a profit through speculation is mentioned. The Czechoslovak government has imposed a tax of 1 per cent on the users of works of art payable to the Funds. He points out that at present the sums being paid under this law do not correspond by far to the standard fixed for values created by the plastic arts. /// L'auteur explique que, lorsqu'on parle de l'économie des arts plastiques, on se réfère généralement à la vente et à la présentation d'œuvres dans des galeries ou des expositions.

Quelques chiffres montrent que les achats des particuliers croissent régulièrement. L'auteur traite de l'un des problèmes de l'économie de l'art: la détermination de la valeur d'une œuvre et de son prix. La somme reçue par un artiste pour une œuvre ne représente pas nécessairement une estimation exacte de sa valeur culturelle, en particulier en ce qui concerne sa valeur éventuelle dans l'avenir. L'auteur mentionne la possibilité pour les acheteurs de tirer des bénéfices de la spéculation en ce domaine. Le gouvernement tchécoslovaque a imposé aux utilisateurs d'œuvres d'art une taxe de 1 pour cent à verser au Fonds. L'auteur souligne que, dans l'état actuel des choses, les sommes versées au titre de cette taxe ne correspondent que de loin aux standards fixés aux valeurs créées par les arts plastiques."
"10.2307/1572122","Foundation Studies in Art Today","Erik Sonntag","Leonardo",2,"4",1969-10-01,"pp. 387-397","10.2307/1572122","The MIT Press","fla","","Highlighted by the events which led to the revolt of the art students at Guildford and Hornsey, art education in institutes of further education in Britain has been subjected to much scrutiny. The article takes a look at the history of the system of art examination and education in British colleges of art. One aspect of art education is particularly discussed, namely, the subject of Foundation Studies. The author pays tribute to the Bauhaus (1919-1933), which introduced the concept of the Foundation Course. Today as then, opinions are divided as to what the ingredients of such a course should be. He suggests that perhaps the most important stage during art education is the introductory period, i.e. the first and second year. He draws attention to the current system of education, which does not include this vital period as the official diploma is set up. A typical course is described. The ludicrous situation is pointed out in which after 13 weeks of initial study a student must decide on the area of work in which he will specialize. The original aims of the Foundation Course are thus perverted by a system that is too narrow to include that essential aspect of human nature which needs an understanding of the totality of life. On the basis of his experiences with colleges of art in several European countries, including England, the author describes apparent differences in attitudes and work produced. Major questions were often left unanswered: Do present systems of selection in education really recognize creative talent? How valid is visual education? If it is valid, should not all art students be subjected to a Foundation Course? Foundation Studies are a means of learning to see. A Foundation Course must provide a grammar and vocabulary for pictorial construction and an understanding of fundamental ideas together with the conceptions and possibilities of their visual expression and interpretation. The author offers his solution to the problem of Foundation Studies and discusses it in detail. He believes that Foundation Studies are more relevant today than ever. An environment should exist for art education which will make it possible for men and women to understand their world and to invent and create forms symbolizing that world. /// Les événements qui ont amené la révolte des étudiants en art à Guildford et à Hornsey ont attiré l'attention sur l'enseignement de l'art dans les instituts d'études supérieures de Grande-Bretagne. Cet article fait un rappel historique du système d'enseignement et d'examens dans les écoles d'art. L'auteur étudie particulièrement l'un des aspects de cet enseignement, c'est à dire les Cours Préparatoires. L'auteur rend hommage au Bauhaus (1919-1933) qui a introduit l'idée du Cours Préparatoire. Maintenant comme alors, les opinions s'affrontent sur ce que devraient être les composantes d'un tel cours. Pour l'auteur, l'étape la plus importante de l'enseignement de l'art est la période d'introduction, c'est-à-dire les deux premières années. Il souligne que la composition du diplôme final de cet enseignement ne tient pas compte de cette période vitale. Il décrit ensuite un Cours Préparatoire typique. Après treize semaines d'études d'initiation, un étudiant doit décider de sa future spécialisation, ce qui est grotesque. Le but original du Cours Préparatoire est donc perverti par un système trop rigide pour en assimiler l'aspect le plus important, c'est à dire ce trait de la nature humaine qui conduit à une compréhension de la totalité de la vie. Sur la base de son expérience des écoles d'art de plusieurs pays d'Europe, y compris l'Angleterre, l'auteur décrit les différences qui apparaissent dans les attitudes et les œuvres produites. A son avis, les questions les plus importantes ne reçoivent pas de réponse: Les systèmes d'éducation actuels reconnaissent-ils réellement le talent créateur? Quelle est la valeur de l'éducation plastique? Si elle est valable, tout le monde ne devrait-il pas suivre un Cours Préparatoire? Les Etudes Préparatoires sont un moyen d'apprendre à regarder. Un Cours Préparatoire doit fournir une grammaire et un vocabulaire à la construction picturale, une compréhension des idées fondamentales, et des conceptions et des possibilités d'expression et d'interprétation plastiques. L'auteur offre une solution au problème posé par le Cours Préparatoire, et l'étudie de manière détaillée. Pour lui, les Etudes Préparatoires sont plus importantes maintenant que jamais. Il faudrait fournir un environnement dans lequel l'enseignement de l'art aurait sa place, de manière à permettre à l'homme de comprendre le monde, et d'inventer et de créer des formes le symbolisant."

He gives some of the reasons for the isolation and the boycott in which American abstract artists found themselves during that decade and the role of the museums and the critics in those days. He mentions some of the pioneer, abstract murals painted by several of his fellow artists and himself during that decade, which were and still are totally ignored by the art historians. He explains his own gradual development in the Neoplastic direction. While discussing his work during the period 1940-1950, he defines both Neoplasticism and its basic differences with other forms of, so-called, Hard Edge painting. He goes into the early differences in the work of the pioneers of Neoplasticism, Mondrian, Van Doesburg and Vantongerloo. He then points out the differences between the work of the American and European Neoplastic-style painters. He explains that the importance of these differences, generally unrealized by the critics, is that they provide the necessary flexibility for the continuing development of Neoplastic painting. The author discusses the development of his own Neoplastic work during the period 1950 to date. He discusses how the unusual format of his 'Cinema-I' mural and his three-dimensional column constructions enables him to introduce the time element into Neoplastic art. The author explains his reasons for not carrying the principles of Neoplasticism into his experimental film work and his play-writing. He concludes by stating his reasons for the continuing need for Neoplastic art in the present-day world. /// L'auteur étudie les débuts et le développement de l'art abstrait aux Etats Unis pendant les années 1930-1940, ainsi que son rôle personnel à cette époque. Il explique les raisons pour lesquelles les artistes abstraits américains ont été boycottés et maintenus dans l'isolement pendant cette période, et expose le rôle joué par les musées et les critiques. Il mentionne certaines des peintures abstraites sur murs, œuvres d'avant garde, que plusieurs artistes et lui-même avaient alors réalisées, et qui furent et sont d'ailleurs toujours complètement ignorées par les historiens de l'art. Il explique comment il s'est graduellement tourné vers le Néoplasticisme. A l'occasion de l'exposé de son œuvre entre 1940 et 1950, il donne une définition du Néoplasticisme et de ses différences fondamentales avec les autres formes de peinture 'Hard Edge'. Il expose en quoi les œuvres des pionniers du Néoplasticisme, Mondrian, Van Doesburg et Vantongerloo, étaient différentes à l'origine; il souligne ensuite les différences qui existent entre les œuvres des peintres Néoplastiques américains et européens. Il explique que ces différences, généralement non perçues par les critiques, sont en fait fort importantes, car elles sont à la base de la souplesse qui permet le développement continu de la peinture Néoplastique. L'auteur traite de son œuvre Néoplastique depuis 1950 jusqu'à nos jours, et montre comment le format inhabituel de sa peinture murale 'Cinema-I' et de ses constructions en forme de colonnes à trois dimensions lui permet d'introduire l'élément temps dans l'art Néoplastique. Enfin il explique pourquoi il n'utilise pas les principes du Néoplasticisme dans son œuvre cinématographique expérimentale ni dans son œuvre dramatique. Pour conclure, il expose pourquoi le besoin de l'art Néoplastique continue à se faire sentir actuellement."
"10.2307/1572152","Plastique constructive de l'espace-temps architectural","Jean Gorin","Leonardo",2,"3",1969-07-01,"pp. 231-238","10.2307/1572152","The MIT Press","fla","","Depuis ses origines, l'architecture n'a cessé d'évoluer en suivant les étapes et les transformations de la vie. L'art, de son côté, suit l'évolution de la science, et l'auteur pense que l'évolution plastique tend vers des formes universelles, vers une expression de la plastique 'pure' et constructive. 'Pure' création de l'esprit, fondé sur des valeurs universelles, l'art constructif révèle une nouvelle vision du monde sensible. En 1930, l'auteur, dépassant le cadre du tableau, crée une architecture de 'l'espace plastique', dans laquelle la couleur acquiert une réelle fonction équilibrante. L'auteur pense que ces structures sont en rapport avec les grands principes qui situent l'œuvre en harmonie avec les lois qui gèrent le cosmos. Il en résulte que la couleur devient alors un élément même de l'architecture permettant à l'homme de vivre en complet équilibre psychique dans son environnement. Le développement des techniques de construction industrielle, et l'apparition de matériaux nouveaux rendent possible ce genre d'architecture à l'heure actuelle. Selon le souhait de Mondrian, la cité pourra être organisée comme un grand organisme fonctionnel, où toutes les manifestations de la vie individuelle et collective se développeront dans une ambiance 'plastique' équilibrée et harmonieuse. /// Since its origin, architecture has evolved in parallel with the stages and transformations of life. Similarly, art follows the evolution of science and, the author believes, the plastic arts tend to universal forms--towards the expression of 'pure' and constructive plasticism. Constructivist art, a 'pure' creation of the mind based on universal values, reveals a new vision of the world. In 1930, the author began working beyond the scope of the picture by producing an architecture of 'plastic space', an architecture in which colour acquires a real function of equilibrium. These structures, the author believes, are related to, and in harmony with the laws of nature. As a result, colour becomes an architectural element contributing to the possibility of man living in psychic equilibrium with his environment. The development and techniques of industrial construction and new materials make possible this kind of architecture. It will meet Mondrian's ideas for organizing the city as a large functional organism where individual and collective life can be developed in a 'plastic' environment that brings equilibrium and harmony."
"10.2307/1572153","Horizontally Oriented Rotating Kinetic Painting","Robert Henry","Leonardo",2,"3",1969-07-01,"pp. 239-250","10.2307/1572153","The MIT Press","fla","","An aesthetic of kinetic art is established upon the principle that all art is essentially contemplative. Art which is subject to change must also be apprehended as a total structure. The author believes that if the total structure cannot be perceived at a single moment, then it is necessary that past moments be remembered with some degree of completeness. Those elements in a work which are remembered, form a sub-structure upon which the less stable, textural elements rest. By and large, a painting is accessible as a total structure at any single moment of time. The multiple structural possibilities implicit in a non-kinetic work of art are a result of the viewer's ability to impose his own time sequence upon the work. The dynamics of the viewer's time sequence, set against the more stable structure of the picture, are the basis of contemplation. The illusionistic depth in a painting is heightened when stereoptic techniques and dynamic changes of focal points are employed. The focus mechanism of the eye differs in an important way from that of the camera. If a picture is viewed obliquely, the spatial possibilities of the composition are multiplied. In a rotating, ceiling-hung painting, a number of devices which expand the possibilities of relationship are introduced into painting. As a painting rotates, forms seem to shrink and expand, and forms assume different spatial positions. The far side of the painting may appear to be near side, and the direction of rotation may seem to change. Since points on a rotating plane increase in actual speed as they approach the circumference of the circle, while at the same time, centers of the viewer's interest tend to become centers of implied rotation as well, various kinetic and spatial interpretations of a single work are possible. Because of these changes in the perception of the painting, while the painting itself does not change, the criteria for contemplation described above are met. /// L'esthétique de l'art cinétique est fondée sur le principe que tout art est essentiellement contemplatif. L'art qui subit des changements doit aussi être appréhendé comme une structure d'ensemble. Si la structure ne peut être perçue toute entière à un instant donné, il faut alors que le spectateur se souvienne dans une certaine mesure des moments précédents. Dans une œuvre, ces éléments dont on se souvient forment une infrastructure sur laquelle reposent les éléments texturaux moins stables. Dans l'ensemble, un tableau peut être appréhendé comme une structure complète à chaque instant. Les multiples possibilités structurales impliquées dans une œuvre d'art non-cinétique résultent de l'opportunité qu'a le spectateur de lui imposer une séquence temporelle qui lui est propre. La dynamique de cette séquence, ajoutée à la structure stable du tableau, forme la base de la contemplation. La profondeur illusoire d'un tableau est accentuée grâce à l'utilisation de techniques stéréoptiques et de changements dynamiques des points focaux. Le mécanisme focal de l'œil diffère notablement de celui d'une caméra. Si un tableau est vu sous un angle oblique, les possibilités spatiales de composition sont multipliées. Dans un tableau pivotant pendu au plafond, un certain nombre de mécanismes qui augmentent les possibilités de relation est introduit. Au fur et à mesure que la peinture pivote, des formes semblent se rétrécir et s'étirer, et elles occupent différentes positions dans l'espace. Le côté le plus éloigné du tableau peut paraître le plus proche, et la direction du mouvement de rotation peut sembler changer. Comme les points situés sur un plan pivotant voient leur vitesse réelle augmenter en approchant du pourtour de la circonférence du cercle, pendant que les centres d'intêret du spectateur tendent aussi à devenir les centres d'une rotation inhérente, de nombreuses interprétations cinétiques et spatiales d'une même œuvre sont possibles. A cause de ces changements dans la perception d'un tableau, alors que le tableau lui-même ne change pas, les exigences de la contemplation décrites ci-dessus sont réalisées."

Wier","Leonardo",2,"3",1969-07-01,"pp. 251-256","10.2307/1572154","The MIT Press","fla","","The author describes the production of a light show by projecting light through colored liquid materials on to a screen in the form of the wall of a room. This type of chemical light show is also called a wet show. He points out that a similar type of show was produced long ago by alchemists with simpler materials. The best environment for light shows, the kinds of psychological reactions reported by spectators, the basic equipment and supplies required, and the source of visual effects are described in some detail. Most of the article is devoted to a useful catalog of various chemical materials to place in a clear, concave watch glass (the author used one of 15-in. diameter, which was placed on the top of a commercial-type overhead projector) to produce interesting moving colored images. These materials include: the starting solution placed in the watch glass; acids and bases; pH indicators and dyes for producing various colors; and solvents for producing special effects. Ways of producing additional effects by mechanical means are also mentioned. /// L'auteur explique comment produire un spectacle lumineux au moyen de lumière projetée à travers des liquides colorés dans une pièce dont le mur sert d'écran. Ce type de spectacle lumineux chimique s'appelle aussi spectacle liquide. L'auteur souligne que de tels spectacles ont été produits voilà longtemps par les alchimistes avec des matériaux plus simples. L'environnement préférable pour les spectacles lumineux est décrit en détail, ainsi que certaines réactions psychologiques des spectateurs, l'équipement de base et les matériaux nécessaires, et l'origine des effets visuels. L'article donne une longue liste fort utile des divers produits chimiques qu'il faut placer dans un verre de montre concave et transparent pour produire d'intéressantes images colorées en mouvement. Celui que l'auteur utilise mesure 38 cm de diamètre; et il le place en haut d'un Vü-graph. Les produits chimiques comprennent une solution de départ placée dans le verre de montre, acides ou basiques, des indicateurs de pH et des teintures qui permettent d'obtenir des couleurs variées, ainsi que des solvents qui produisent des effets spéciaux. L'auteur mentionne aussi de quelle manière obtenir des effets additionnels au moyen de procédés mécaniques."
"10.2307/1572155","Cybernetics and Art","Michael J. Apter","Leonardo",2,"3",1969-07-01,"pp. 257-265","10.2307/1572155","The MIT Press","fla","","This article is a non-technical introduction to cybernetics, the study of 'control and communication in the animal and the machine'. A number of fundamental cybernetic concepts are described including some of those involved in information theory (like the notion of a message and amounts of information), in control theory (like homeostasis, negative feedback and servomechanisms) and in automata theory (like algorithms, Turing machines and networks). The structure of cybernetics is outlined showing the relationship between work on the further development of the theory, on understanding organismic processes in cybernetic terms (especially through model building) and on constructing more purposeful hardware systems. Bionics, cybernation and artificial intelligence (which especially involves heuristic programming) are all fields concerned with the development of such hardware systems. It is argued that cybernetics is related to art in three ways: it may be used by the scientist in studying art, it may be used by the artist in creating works of art--and may have been one of the influences behind the development of the idea of machines as works of art and machines for creating art, as well as the increasingly process-oriented nature of contemporary art--and finally cybernetics may itself be regarded in certain respects as an art form in its own right. /// Cet article se veut une introduction non technique à la cybernétique, une étude 'des contrôles et des communications dans l'animal et dans la machine'. Un certain nombre de principes cybernétiques fondamentaux sont décrits, y compris ceux qui traitent de la théorie de l'information (par exemple les notions de message et de quantité d'information), de la théorie des contrôles (par exemple l'homeostase, la contre-réaction et les servomécanismes) et de la théorie des automates (par exemple les algorithmes, les machines de Turing et les réseaux). L'auteur définit la structure de la cybernétique, en montrant les relations qui existent entre les travaux réalisés sur la base des récents progrès faits sur le plan théorique, de la compréhension des processus organismiques en termes cybernétiques, en particulier par la fabrication de modèles, et de la construction de systèmes 'hardware' capable d'une meilleure adaptation en vue d'un but précis. Ces systèmes 'hardware' sont utilisés surtout en bionique, pour l'application industrielle de la cybernétique, et pour l'intelligence artificielle, laquelle nécessite une programmation heuristique. L'auteur pense qu'il existe trois sortes de rapports entre la cybernétique et l'art: le savant peut se servir de la cybernétique pour étudier l'art, l'artiste peut l'utiliser pour créer des œuvres d'art--la cybernétique est peut-être même à l'origine de la notion de machine en tant qu'œuvre d'art et de machine créant l'art--et enfin la cybernétique peut être dans une certaine mesure considérée elle-même comme une forme d'art à part entière."

Tolansky","Leonardo",2,"3",1969-07-01,"pp. 267-274","10.2307/1572156","The MIT Press","fla","","The author points out that Bowditch in 1815 first discussed the striking curvilinear patterns produced by the graphical combination of two vibrations moving at right angles to each other. Similar patterns were described by Lissajous in 1857. Sophisticated electronic systems cannot create patterns which even remotely compare either in interest or in aesthetic appeal with those that can be formed by quite crude mechanical pendulum devices. Two devices are described in detail: one with two pendulums with variable inclination of axes and one with a single pendulum provided with a perturbing pendulum. He shows examples of the kinds of patterns that they produce and how they depend on factors controllable by the operator. The fact that it is not possible ever to reproduce the same pattern, even with the same device, is demonstrated by the author--thus each design can be copyrighted by an operator, if he is so inclined. The patterns obtained depend entirely on the skill and knowledge of the operator. The growth of a pattern, he states, is fascinating to watch and can easily be photographed on ciné film with obvious application in film captioning and other fields. /// L'auteur souligne que Bowditch fut le premier en 1815 à traiter des dessins curvilignes remarquables produits par la combinaison graphique de deux mouvements vibratoires formant un angle droit l'un avec l'autre. Des dessins similaires ont été décrits en 1857 par Lissajous. En fait, les systèmes électroniques les plus élaborés sont loins d'arriver à créer des dessins comparables en intérêt et en beauté à ceux que l'on forme à l'aide d'appareils mécaniques assez simples. Deux appareils sont décrits d'une manière détaillée. L'un d'eux est composé de deux pendules dont l'axe présente une inclinaison variable. L'autre est formé d'un pendule auquel est suspendu un autre pendule plus petit qui perturbe le mouvement du premier. L'auteur donne des exemples des genres de dessins qu'ils permettent d'obtenir, et explique qu'ils dépendent de facteurs contrôlables par un opérateur. L'auteur démontre qu'il n'est jamais possible de reproduire le même dessin, même si le même appareil est utilisé; de cette façon, chaque opérateur peut, s'il le désire, faire bréveter chacun des dessins qu'il obtient. Les dessins produits dépendent entièrement de l'habileté et du savoir de l'opérateur. L'élaboration de ces dessins est un spectacle fascinant, qui peut facilement faire l'objet d'une prise de vues cinématographique. On peut les utiliser pour fournir un fond à un générique de film, par exemple, mais ils peuvent aussi s'appliquer à de nombreux autres domaines."

The author explores various factors which have influenced a separation of these two art forms, among which is a misinterpretation of 'functionalism'. Economic, social and esthetic advantages as well as historical affinity are cited as reasons obliging a greater use of sculpture in the environment. Sculpture-in-architecture is defined and the author analyses the various practical and esthetic problems confronting sculptor and architect. Functional and psychological modes of integration are discussed as generative factors for possible locations. The determining factors for size and materials are considered. The author points to the need for sculptor and architect to work together from the inception of a project. He recognizes the problems architects have in selecting a sculptor and makes several practical recommendations. /// L'analyse des problèmes de la vie moderne en rapport avec son milieu matériel montre la nécessité de nouveaux rapports entre la sculpture et l'architecture. L'auteur étudie les différents facteurs qui ont provoqué le divorce entre ces deux arts parmi lesquels figure la mauvaise interpretation du 'fonctionnalisme'.

He found that perceivers trained in an older, 'romantic', more affective orientation were the most disturbed when they felt that the sacred space of a museum or gallery was violated. Those accustomed to perceiving events in galleries as a species of intellectual game were not disturbed--they accepted the notion that innovations in aesthetic experience might be performed at any point in the experience: in the objects, in the physical setting, in the definition of roles, in the relations between originator and recipient, anywhere. His experiments lead him to conclude that the art world (in its broadest aspects in, for example, Canada) is the prime institutional realm in which innovators can experiment with symbols of thinking and feeling and action as much as they like, and with the least risk of life, sustenance or anything else the society usually regards as serious and important. /// L'auteur rend compte de quatre expériences auxquelles il a procédé dans le but de déterminer les réactions d'un spectateur devant un certain choix d'objets qui n'étaient pas faits expressément comme des objets d'art, mais qui en raison de leur emplacement et de la manière dont ils étaient présentés, amèneraient le spectateur à croire qu'il s'agissait d'objets d'art. Il constata que les sujets élevés dans une optique plus traditionnelle, 'romantique', affective, étaient les plus troublés quand l'espace sacré d'un musée ou d'une galerie était violé. Ceux qui étaient habitués à considérer ce qui se passe dans les galeries d'art comme une sorte de jeu intellectuel n'étaient pas troublés. Ils acceptaient le fait que des innovations esthétiques puissent être faites dans n'importe quel domaine de l'expérience: dans les objets, dans l'environnement, dans la définition des rôles, dans les relations entre le créateur et le spectateur, n'importe où. Ses expériences l'amènent à la conclusion que le monde des arts (dans ses aspects les plus larges, au Canada par exemple) est le premier royaume institutionnel dans lequel les innovateurs peuvent expérimenter autant qu'ils veulent à l'aide de symboles de pensée, de sentiments et d'action, et sans mettre en danger la vie, ni la subsistance, ni tout ce que la société considère habituellement comme étant sérieux et d'importance."

In this article, the author points out that many forms found in rock are not accidental. Examples are given that show how many forms are an expression of the internal fabric of rocks, and range in size from millimeters to tens of kilometers. Thin-sections of rocks viewed under the polarizing microscope reveal a great variety of forms, colors and textures that have aesthetic appeal. He discusses his technique of projecting color slides of aesthetically satisfying 'compositions' from thin-sections of rock onto a canvas, interpreting them and executing them in paint. He speculates that both artist and scientist are aware of similar forms, which in art are called 'abstract' forms, and that perhaps their perception transmits a non-verbal kind of communication from the individual's unconscious to his conscious mind. Alternatively, the forms might be interpreted as symbols from the collective unconscious of the human psyche to the conscious mind of the viewer. /// La forme extérieure des roches a depuis longtemps inspiré les artistes dans la création de ce qu'on appelle l'art 'abstrait'. Dans cet article, l'auteur remarque que bien des formes de roches ne sont pas accidentelles.

L'examen au microscope polarisant de minces lamelles de roche révèle une grande variété de formes, de couleurs et de textures qui présentent un intérêt esthétique. Il explique la technique selon laquelle il projette sur une toile des diapositives en couleur représentant des 'compositions' esthétiquement satisfaisantes provenant de minces lamelles de roche, puis les interprète et les reproduit à la peinture. Il estime que les artistes comme les savants connaissent de telles formes, qui du point de vue artistique s'appellent des formes 'abstraites', et que peut-être leur perception transmet une sorte de communication non verbale, de l'inconscient de l'individu à son esprit conscient.

"10.2307/1572226","Drawing as Suspended Narrative","John Elderfield","Leonardo",4,"1",1971-01-01,"pp. 13-22","10.2307/1572226","The MIT Press","fla","","The author's discussion of drawing follows three major themes: (1) a definition of drawing as process, (2) sources in drawing and their exact definition in the drawing itself and (3) the relationship between source and structure in drawing. A definition of drawing is proposed which distinguishes between drawing as source-assimilation, as independent object-making and as directed towards future non-drawing objects. It is suggested that the relationship of drawing and source is of major significance when drawing is defined not as a factual presence but as a process, since drawing thus becomes the assimilation of mental and environmental data. The phrase 'suspension of narrative' is used to signify this assimilation of sources within the activity of drawing and specificity and clarity are cited as prerequisites for exact 'suspension', while randomness might inform the choice of source. The realisation of the suspended narrative utilises the difference in context of the source and its transformation in drawing. Drawing structure is considered as deriving from both source and from the object-character of the drawing, both of which adduce meaning. Structure is defined as more than the framework of the drawing but as identical to the whole work itself. Meaning will occur both in the individual work and be clarified in a series of alike works, where the repetition of similar images will reduce possibilities of misinterpretation in favour of specificity. It is suggested, however, that while source-awareness valuably facilitates sure decisions, sure commitment and sure motivation, it is itself no guarantee of quality, since embryology and meaning need not concur. /// L'auteur discute le dessin sur trois thèmes principaux: (1) définition du dessin en tant que processus, (2) les sources du dessin et leur définition exacte dans le dessin lui-même, et (3) les rapports entre la source et la structure dans le dessin. La définition du dessin proposée par l'auteur établit une distinction entre le dessin en tant qu'assimilation des sources, en tant que production d'un objet indépendant, et en tant qu'élément d'un futur objet qui n'est pas un dessin. L'auteur suggère que les rapports entre le dessin et sa source ont une signification très importante lorsque le dessin se définit, non comme une présence de fait, mais comme un processus, car le dessin devient ainsi l'assimilation des données de l'esprit et de l'environnement. L'expression 'suspension de narration' est utilisée pour rendre compte de cette assimilation des sources dans cette activité qu'est le dessin; la spécificité et la clarté sont considérées comme des préalables à une 'suspension' exacte, tandis qu'une suspension faite au hasard pourrait dénoncer le choix de la source. La réalisation de la narration suspendue fait usage de la différence de contexte entre la source et sa transformation en dessin. La structure du dessin est considérée comme l'aboutissement de la source et de l'objet-caractère du dessin, chacun des deux ajoutant de la signification. La structure se définit comme étant plus que le cadre du tableau, mais comme étant identique à l'ensemble du tableau lui-même. La signification se fera jour dans chaque œuvre et se clarifiera dans une série d'œuvres similaires, où la répétition d'images semblables réduira une éventuelle mauvaise interprétation en faveur d'une spécificité. L'auteur suggère, cependant, que, alors que la conscience des sources facilite notablement la prise des décisions, l'engagement et la motivation, elle n'est pas garante de qualité, car l'embryologie et la signification n'ont pas besoin de s'accorder."

Hoenich","Leonardo",4,"1",1971-01-01,"pp. 23-26","10.2307/1572227","The MIT Press","fla","","The author describes the experimental building designed by the architect Michael Burt, called the 'Hexahyp', at the Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, and the picture he made on parts of its surface. The fiberglass covering consists of saddle-back shaped surfaces of the type that would be assumed by soap films stretched between outlines of the supporting structure. These surfaces, called minimal surfaces, provide the maximum of strength for the minimum amount of material used. His picture, 'Man and the Cosmos', is of the kind called Op art because the spectator experiences strong optical effects as he moves about to see its different parts. The whole of the picture cannot be seen from any viewing position within or outside the building. Its theme is discussed and details of the method of its making are given. /// L'auteur décrit la construction expérimentale appelée 'l'Hexahyp', conçue par l'architecte Michael Burt à l'Institut de Technologie d'Israël, Haïfa, Israël, et le tableau qu'il a fait sur certaines parties de sa surface. La couverture en fibre de verre consiste en surfaces en dos d'âne, de même apparence qu'un film d'eau savonneuse que l'on aurait tendu sur le squelette de la structure première. Ces surfaces, appelées surfaces minimales, permettent d'obtenir une résistance maximale pour un minimum de matériaux utilisés. Sa peinture, 'L'homme et le Cosmos', est de l'Op Art parce que le spectateur fait l'expérience d'effets optiques prononcés lorsqu'il se déplace afin de voir ses différents aspects. L'ensemble de la peinture ne peut jamais être appréhendé visuellement dans sa totalité, que ce soit de l'intérieur ou de l'extérieur du bâtiment. Le thème du tableau est étudié et des détails sur la méthode utilisée pour sa réalisation sont donnés."
"10.2307/1572228","The Information Available in Pictures","James J. Gibson","Leonardo",4,"1",1971-01-01,"pp. 27-35","10.2307/1572228","The MIT Press","fla","","The author reviews two current conflicting theories of what a picture is: (1) that it consists of a sheaf of light rays coming to a station point or perceiver, each corresponding to a spot of color on the picture surface and hence that the picture can stand for a real object or scene insofar as the rays from the picture are the same as the rays from the real object; (2) that it consists of a set of symbols, more or less like words, and the perceiver must learn to 'read' it. According to the first theory, a child can perceive an object in a picture as soon as it can perceive a real object; according to the second one, the child must learn to 'read' the picture much as it learns to read written speech. He points out the fallacies of both theories, shows that they cannot be combined and suggests a new theory based on the radical assumption that light can convey information about the world and, hence, that the phenomenal world does not have to be constructed by the mind (or the brain) out of meaningless data. This theory makes it possible to distinguish between the pictorially mediated perception of the features of a world and the direct perception of the features of the surroundings and yet to understand that there is common information for the features they have in common. His theory accounts for the difference between verbal and visual thinking. Visual thinking is freer and less stereotyped than verbal thinking; there is no vocabulary of picturing as there is of saying. As every artist knows, there are thoughts that can be visualized without being verbalized. /// L'auteur passe en revue deux théories courantes et opposées sur la nature de l'image: (1) l'image est formée d'un faisceau de rayons lumineux convergeant vers un point précis: le spectateur; chaque rayon correspond à une tache de couleur sur la surface de l'image et par conséquent celle-ci peut être considérée comme un objet réel ou une scène dans la mesure où les rayons provenant de l'image sont semblables aux rayons provenant de l'objet réel; (2) l'image est formée par un ensemble de symboles qui sont à peu près comme les mots et le spectateur doit apprendre à la 'lire'. Selon la première théorie, un enfant peut percevoir un objet dans une image dès qu'il peut percevoir l'objet réel; selon la seconde, l'enfant doit apprendre à 'lire' l'image de la même façon qu'il doit apprendre à lire le discours écrit. Il met en évidence ce qu'il y a de faux dans ces deux théories, montre qu'elles ne peuvent se combiner et suggère une nouvelle théorie basée sur l'hypothèse hardie que la lumière peut véhiculer de l'information et que par conséquent l'esprit (ou le cerveau) n'a pas besoin de construire le monde des apparences à partir de données dépourvues de signification. Cette théorie rend possible la distinction entre la perception du monde médiatisée par l'image et la perception directe de ce qui nous entoure tout en nous permettant de comprendre qu'une information semblable rende compte de leurs particularités communes. Cette théorie précise la différence entre la pensée verbale et la pensée en images. La pensée en images est plus libre et moins stéréotypée que la pensée verbale; il n'y a pas de vocabulaire de l'image comme il y a un vocabulaire de la parole. Les artistes savent bien qu'il y a des pensées qu'on peut imaginer sans les formuler."

Marzio","Leonardo",4,"1",1971-01-01,"pp. 37-48","10.2307/1572229","The MIT Press","fla","","The author points out that the development of lithographic technology falls into three periods: (1) 1800 to 1820--European artists learned the characteristics of the medium, with little thought to creating a popular or democratic art, a good method of preparing and inking stones was found by Senefelder in Bavaria, and at the end of the period his method was introduced to America; (2) 1820 to 1855--artists and businessmen tried to use lithography to reach all the people, Americans followed the European lead but presses were too slow for large production of prints and (3) 1855 to 1890--Americans successfully applied their inventive abilities to the development of steam-operated automatic presses but lithography became a medium for American business and 'artistic' emphasis vanished. Throughout all three periods the debt of America to Europe was immense, for the lithographic craft was essentially developed in Germany, France and England. 'Artistic' and popular prints produced by American lithographic companies in the nineteenth century seem native to America and it is often difficult to see them as products of European technology. /// L'auteur montre que le développement de la lithographie se divise en trois périodes: (1) de 1800 à 1820 les artistes européens s'initient aux caractéristiques de cette technique et ne pensent guère à créer un art populaire et démocratique, en Bavière, Senefelder découvre une bonne méthode pour préparer et encrer la pierre et, à la fin de la période considérée, cette méthode est introduite en Amérique; (2) de 1820 à 1855, les artistes et les hommes d'affaires essaient de se servir de la lithographie pour toucher les masses, les Américains suivent les traces des Européens mais le travail à la presse est trop lent pour obtenir une grande production; et (3) de 1855 à 1890 les Américains utilisent avec succès leurs capacités d'invention pour développer les presses automatiques à vapeur, mais la lithographie devient un moyen au service du commerce américain et la qualité artistique disparait. Pendant ces trois périodes, la dette de l'Amérique envers l'Europe est immense car l'art de la lithographie s'est developpé surtout en Allemagne en France et en Angleterre. Les lithographies 'artistiques' et populaires qui sortent des presses américaines au dix-neuvième siècle semblent être d'origine américaine et il est souvent difficile de les reconnaître comme des produits de la technologie européenne."
"10.2307/1572230","Aesthetics and the Artist Today","Harold Osborne","Leonardo",4,"1",1971-01-01,"pp. 49-54","10.2307/1572230","The MIT Press","fla","","The author discusses what bearings, if any, aesthetics has, or could have, for the practising artist. He points out that the 'artist type' is a myth--the notion of the persona of the artist changes with time and several notions may exist at the same time. If it is asked what aesthetics holds for the artist, the answer is--which artist? Aesthetics, a branch of philosophy, has as its goal the theoretical analysis and understanding of a major field of values. Predicting the artistic taste of the future is not one of its aims. Each artist must decide for himself whether such intellectualization is of aid to him. He states that the desire to understand the logical nature of aesthetic judgement has been a central preoccupation of contemporary aesthetics, particularly in Anglo-Saxon countries. A basic assumption is that 'fine art' cannot be reduced to reason and rule but is the product of something called 'genius', as expressed by Kant during the Age of Romanticism. Although there is a community of interests between aestheticians and artists, it is not surprising if disappointment ensues when it becomes apparent to artists that theory offers no conclusive answers to most of the practical problems perennially debated by them and their friends. He illustrates how aesthetics deals with assumptions that underlie contemporary thinking in the arts, e.g. that self-expression is an aesthetic value in itself. If the artist says that he does not want to bother with logic-chopping but just to get on with the job, aestheticians take off their hats to him. But if he wants to talk and think, then it is advantageous to understand the true nature of the concepts in use, which is so often taken on trust. /// L'auteur débat des rapports--s'ils existent ou peuvent exister--entre l'esthétique et l'artiste praticien. Il met en évidence le fait que la catégorie 'artiste' est un mythe--la notion de persona de l'artiste changeant avec les époques et plusieurs de ces notions pouvant coexister au même moment. Si l'on demande ce que l'esthétique représente pour l'artiste, la réponse est: quel artiste? L'esthétique, branche de la philosophie, a comme but l'analyse théorique et la compréhension d'un important champ de valeurs. Prédire le futur en matière de goûts artistiques n'est pas son but. Chaque artiste doit décider en lui-même si une telle intellectualisation peut lui être utile ou non. L'auteur démontre que le désir de comprendre la nature logique du jugement esthétique a été une préoccupation dominante de l'esthétique contemporaine, particulièrement en pays anglo-saxons. L'hypothèse de base est que les 'beaux-arts' ne peuvent pas être réduits en termes de raison et de règles, mais sont le produit de quelque chose appelé 'génie', selon l'expression de Kant, au moment du Romantisme. Bien qu'il y ait une communauté d'intérets entre les esthéticiens et les artistes, il n'est pas surprenant que ces derniers ressentent une certaine déception lorsqu'il apparaît qu'aucune théorie n'apporte de réponses concluantes aux problèmes pratiques perpétuellement débattus entre eux et leurs amis. L'auteur montre également comment l'esthétique traite les hypothèses qui soustendent la pensée contemporaine en matière d'art. Cette expression personnelle est une valeur esthétique en soi. Si l'artiste dit qu'il ne veut pas s'occuper de logique mais seulement faire son travail, les esthéticiens lui en reconnaissent le droit. Mais s'il veut parler et penser, il est préférable de comprendre la véritable nature des concepts en usage, auxquels souvent on ne peut pas se fier."

Le procédé du collage est particulièrement bien adapté à un mode de création qui consiste à provoquer le hasard, accepter les rencontres fortuites, ne pas partir d'une idée préconçue mais à provoquer une rencontre avec un autre soi-même. L'auteur voit l'origine de son goût du collage dans le spectacle inépuisable des murs de Paris, des affiches, qui, même lacérées, gardent leur force de communication. Enfin l'auteur prévoit que la période actuelle d'indécision en art prépare une nouvelle cristallisation qui établira une harmonie entre l'architecture et la vie. /// The author analyses some of the reasons that cause her to be particularly attracted to the collage technique. She finds that it allows a personal detachment leading to greater freedom of invention, the use of accidental effects and contrasting materials, and a succession of images up to the point where a collage is finished. The technique is particularly suitable for one interested in provoking and taking advantage of chance, in avoiding preconceived ideas and in encountering different aspects of oneself. The author traces the origin of her taste for collage to the inexhaustible riches of the walls of Paris, their posters that, even when torn, retain their power of communication. Finally, she predicts that the present unsettled period in art will bring about a new crystallization leading to harmony between architecture and life."

Gibson","Leonardo",3,"4",1970-10-01,"pp. 425-427","10.2307/1572259","The MIT Press","fla","","The author challenges the concept that hallucination is indistinguishable from perception. His view is that a mental image, such as that occurring in a hallucination, can be differentiated from a percept when perception takes place over a period of time. His theory is supported by the fact that during perception the percept is subject to tests for reality, for example, scanning and inspection with the eyes and by head, hand and body movements, whereas mental images are not subject to investigation or susceptible to increased clarity by any of these physical actions. Often persons having hallucinations or 'psychedelic experiences' feel that their mental images are no different from percepts because they fail to apply the necessary tests, owing to disinclination or passivity under the influence of disease or drugs. His theory also explains the experiences of daydreams and night dreams. He points out that artists have long known that a picture can 'fool the eye'. But by using both eyes and by moving the head, the flat surface of the picture will always be revealed. /// L'auteur récuse le concept selon lequel l'hallucination ne peut se distinguer de la perception. Il part du point de vue qu'une image mentale, telle que celle provoquée par une hallucination, peut être différenciée d'une image perçue quand la perception dure un certain temps. Sa théorie est étayée par le fait que, durant le temps de la perception, la chose perçue peut être sujette à des tests prouvant sa réalité, par exemple investigations et inspections aux moyens des yeux et de la tête, de la main et des mouvements du corps, tandis que les images mentales ne sont pas sujettes à l'investigation ou susceptibles d'être plus clairement appréhendées au moyen de l'une quelconque de ces actions physiques. Souvent, des personnes, ayant des hallucinations ou des 'expériences psychédéliques' prétendent que leurs images mentales ne sont pas différentes des perceptions objectives, parce que, sous l'influence de la maladie ou des drogues, elles s'abstiennent, par négligence ou par passivité, d'y appliquer les tests nécessaires. La théorie de l'auteur explique également les expériences de rêve éveillé et de rêve nocturne. Il met en évidence que depuis longtemps, les artistes savent qu'une image peut 'tromper l'œil'.

His contributions to art teaching and to visual articulation in this century are already well recognized. Although he became known first as a successful teacher and only later as a successful painter, in recent years he has become one of the most widely exhibited artists and today his own artistic work seems better known than his teaching. He was aware of and explored the principles underlying so-called optical art before it evolved as a movement and his studies of the interaction of lines and the interaction of color have progressed in a characteristically creative, individualistic fashion. His unique approach has had a significant effect on the development of contemporary art movements. Professor Albers' work also has scientific and mathematical aspects, and this, in part at least, is responsible for the conception and contents of the conversation reported here, since both interviewers are active as physical scientists. The portion printed here is a much edited version of the original four hours of conversation but we have tried to leave the responses in their original form in the hope that something of Albers' strong and vital personality will be revealed.

He began his work with light instruments in 1905 that culminated in his ""Clavilux,"" a key board instrument, for the projection on a large screen of his ""Lumia"" compositions. As early as 1922, he gave ""Clavilux"" concerts in the United States, Canada and Europe. In 1930, he founded The Art Institute of Light in the United States for research on the ways of producing ""Lumia"" compositions. He directed it until it came to an end in 1943, through lack of funds, however, he still considered the Institute as existing thereafter at his studio. He continued to make ""Lumia"" kinetic art objects using reflected light on a translucid screen until his death.

An important start has been made in the establishment of oil paint standards but some manufacturers do not meet them. The technological aspects of acrylic paint are more complex, yet no action appears to be underway in establishing standards for them. Artists should now demand and receive the best quality paint that modern technology can provide. The author describes his experiences in making paintings from a chemist's point of view. His switch from oils to encaustic permitted a do-it-yourself approach to making durable, high quality paint from excellent materials. More recently he has used acrylic resins in making his own acrylic paints. He presents several formulations of materials of high quality for painting that he has used. /// L'auteur expose le problème de la qualité des peintures destinées aux artistes, d'une part en se référant à ses propres œuvres, et d'autre part dans l'optique des peintres et des conservateurs en général.

He claims that art has largely ignored the fact that man is a binocular species who perceives space stereoscopically. The author points out the analogies between visual stereo space, color perception and binaural sound perception. The possible relationship between stereo cues and biologically inherited sensitivities, on the one hand, and sensory cultural habits, on the other hand, is also examined. A brief historical excursion is made highlighting the more interesting ways in which artists have used stereoscopic media. Finally, the author describes the unique plasticity of stereo space inherent in the technique of stereoscopy which is of greater interest to the artist than its realism. /// L'auteur affirme que l'artiste commence aujourd'hui à explorer la perception de l'espace stéréo comme un moyen visuel présentant d'immenses potentialités pour l'expression artistique. Selon lui, l'art a beaucoup trop ignoré le fait que l'homme est une espèce binoculaire qui perçoit l'espace de façon stéréoscopique.

"10.2307/1572297","On Architecture, the Plastic Arts and the Cultural Evolution of Man","Arpad Mezei","Leonardo",4,"3",1971-07-01,"pp. 239-244","10.2307/1572297","The MIT Press","fla","","Man's specific nature may be defined as an attempt to gain autonomy from environmental influences by means of inhibiting responses. The inhibitory mechanisms employed perform also steering functions. In stress situations, behavior based on inhibition takes the form of flight--according to Cannon's hypotheses. Natural caves offered man a passive way to escape from existential stress. For the primitive nervous system, cave-dwelling would represent sensory deprivation. This would lead, as recent research has shown, to the occurrence of projective hallucinations. Persons with tendencies to introversion and with better developed nervous systems can control these hallucinations and transform them into creative action, such as painting. Art, assumed by the author to have originated in this way, is an important antidote for overcoming the monotony of living in a cave. As man becomes more independent of nature, past, present and future, memory and foresight gain increasing importance. The author proposes the hypothesis that the plastic fine arts were also developed to cope with his consciousness of time. Painting is concerned with the events of the present, architecture with those involving the time unit of the year and sculpture with death and eternity. In periods when one of the three time aspects becomes dominant, the art corresponding to that particular aspect becomes central. In addition and as a consequence of dominance, the functions of the other arts may be transformed, giving rise to a mixture of them (mixed media). /// La nature spécifique de l'homme peut être définie comme un effort pour se soustraire aux influences du milieu extérieur et conquérir ainsi l'autonomie par le moyen de réactions d'inhibition. Les mécanismes inhibiteurs utilisés ont aussi une fonction déterminante pour la conduite. Dans les situations de danger, le comportement basé sur l'inhibition prend la forme du vol--selon les hypothèses de Cannon. Les grottes naturelles offrirent à l'homme un moyen passif d'échapper au danger existentiel. Pour le système nerveux primitif, l'habitation dans des cavernes représentait une privation sensorielle. Ceci conduisait, comme l'ont montré des recherches récentes, à des hallucinations projectives. Les personnes ayant des tendances à l'introversion et des systèmes nerveux mieux développés peuvent contrôler ces hallucinations et les transformer en un acte créateur tel que la peinture. L'art, qui, selon l'auteur, est apparu ainsi, est un important antidote pour surmonter la monotonie de la vie en caverne. A mesure que l'homme conquiert son indépendance en se détachant de la nature, le passé, le présent et le futur, la mémoire et les prévisions prennent de plus en plus d'importance. L'auteur émet l'hypothèse selon laquelle les arts plastiques se seraient aussi développés en réponse à la prise de conscience par l'homme de la temporalité. La peinture s'intéresse aux évènements du présent, l'architecture à ceux qui se rapportent à l'unité de temps qu'est l'année et la sculpture à la mort et à l'éternité. Dans les périodes où l'un des trois aspects du temps domine, la forme d'art qui correspond à cet aspect particulier devient centrale. Par suite de cette domination, les fonctions des autres arts peuvent être transformées, et donner lieu à un mélange des formes d'art (mixed media)."

Schwartz, Reta Shacknove Schwartz","Leonardo",4,"3",1971-07-01,"pp. 245-254","10.2307/1572298","The MIT Press","fla","","NO-art was a cohesive, identifiable movement that lasted five years, 1959-1964. It was a form of anti-art in which artists rebelled against the destructive elements in contemporary industrial society. Exploitation and pollution were their chief targets, whether in politics, human relations or in art. The NO-artists sought to shock the viewer by making larger than life its corrosive aspects. The intent was to uncover the decent elements in each person by direct confrontation with the deceits generally accepted. Social issues were examined and attacked. The authors examine the social and psychological originations of NO-art and place it in art historical perspective. The authors see NO-artists as arising in reaction to the McCarthy era in the United States of America. In their opinion several American myths were exposed by the McCarthy hysteria; namely, that America can tolerate individual differences and that its form of government is sufficiently balanced to check excesses in any branch. The authors offer as an additional understanding that the family and the upbringing of a child in it require conformism and rebellion. The excessive demand for submission results in emotional disorder and excessive anti-traditional (authority) strivings. The toilet-training period determines in good measure the coming struggle for social power and the moral values of the adult. Excessive emphasis upon control results in the later development of anal characteristics. NO-art had many anal aspects; often their overt expression took the form of feces and even an entire exhibition of mounds of sculpted excrement. But the repugnance of the observer, say the authors, must not permit him to deny the esthetic aspect of these art products. Connections are made between NO-art and later developments in art and other social institutions. /// Le NO-art était un mouvement cohérent et identifiable, qui dura 5 ans, de 1959 à 1964. C'était une forme d'anti-art par laquelle les artistes se révoltaient contre les éléments destructeurs de la société industrielle contemporaine. L'exploitation et la pollution étaient leur cibles essentielles, que ce soit dans le domaine politique, social ou artistique. Ces artistes cherchaient à choquer le spectateur en faisant ressortir les aspects corrosifs de la vie. Leur intention était de faire tomber le masque de décence de chacun par une confrontation directe avec les duperies communément acceptées. Ils s'attaquaient résolument aux problèmes sociaux. Les auteurs étudient les origines sociales et psychologiques du NO-art et le replacent dans son contexte artistique et historique. Selon eux, le NO-art est une réaction contre l'ère de McCarthy aux Etats-Unis. A leur avis, l'hystérie maccarthiste révéla un certain nombre de caractéristiques américaines, à savoir que l'Amérique peut tolérer les différences individuelles et que sa forme de gouvernement est suffisamment équilibrée pour contrôler les excès dans n'importe quel domaine. Les auteurs proposent une explication supplémentaire, selon laquelle le conformisme et la rébellion sont deux facteurs nécessaires de l'éducation d'un enfant au sein de la famille. Une exigence excessive de soumission amène des troubles émotionnels et entraîne des réactions de lutte contre la tradition et l'autorité. La période où l'enfant apprend à être propre détermine pour une grande part la future lutte pour le pouvoir social, et les valeurs morales de l'adulte. Trop d'insistance sur la nécessité de se contrôler a pour conséquence la survivance de caractères annaux au cours du développement ultérieur. Le NO-art avait de nombreux aspects annaux, qui se manifestaient souvent par la représentation de fèces, ceci pouvant aller jusqu'à une exposition entièrement consacrée à des montagnes d'excréments sculptés. Mais la répugnance du spectateur, selon les auteurs, ne doit pas l'empêcher de reconnaître l'aspect esthétique de ces œuvres d'art. Une étude est faite des rapports du NO-art avec certains développements artistiques ultérieurs, et avec d'autres institutions sociales."

"10.2307/1572337","The Shape of Things Seen: The Interpretation of Form in Biology","Philip C. Ritterbush","Leonardo",3,"3",1970-07-01,"pp. 305-317","10.2307/1572337","The MIT Press","fla","","The author points out that in art, as in science, form must be distinguished from structure. He regards form as a property which may objectively be correlated with the elements of which a work of art is composed and that, as regards the status of form, art and science are closely allied. When form is properly abstracted from a work of art it represents underlying artistic processes which it is the enterprise of criticism to elucidate, which leads me to suppose that critics might profitably study the science of biological form. The process by which the scientist attributes form to a natural object involves the creative imagination and requires him to exercise powers of visualization of the highest order. It is this visual element, dependent upon the faculty of perception, that lays science open to the influence of the general culture of its time, for we all learn to see in ways that are conditioned by educational institutions, popular media, and the fine arts. The author reviews the use of biological forms by artists during past centuries in Europe and states that in the late nineteenth century many of the leading biologists were artists. Carl Chun, the marine zoologist, adorned his house with frescoes. Theodor Boveri, the embryologist, painted fine landscapes in oil. Haeckel and Doflein did watercolors. In the decades following, generalized organic forms came to figure prominently as motifs in art. They have been used, for example, by Klee, Kandinsky, Gorky, Tanguy and Miro. The interdependence of art and science was great enough over that half century to call for much closer study than it has so far received. In more recent times the biologist has become more sure of the character of structure. The scope for imaginative conjecture has contracted with the development of powerful analytic tools such as the scanning electron microscope. The author suspects that the study of behaviour and the complexity of environmental relations may prove to be areas where strong interactions between art and science will continue to occur. Form, however, is only one aspect, albeit a highly important one, of the interdependence of art and science within the framework of a common culture. /// L'auteur souligne que, dans l'art comme dans la science, la forme doit être différenciée de la structure. Pour lui, la forme est une propriété que l'on peut objectivement comparer aux éléments qui composent une œuvre d'art, si bien qu'en ce qui concerne la forme, l'art et la science présentent des rapports étroits. Quand la forme est en fait abstraite dans une œuvre d'art, elle est la manifestation de procédés artistiques sous-jacents que la critique a pour objet de démontrer; ce qui porte donc l'auteur à penser que les critiques pourraient tirer profit de l'étude de la science des formes biologiques. Le processus suivant lequel un savant attribue une forme à un objet naturel implique l'exercice de son imagination créatrice et de puissants pouvoirs de visualisation. C'est cet élément visuel, qui dépend de la faculté perceptrice, qui permet à la science d'être influencée par la culture générale de son temps, car l'homme apprend à voir à la façon des établissements d'enseignement, des moyens populaires de communication et des arts plastiques avec lesquels il est en contact. L'auteur passe en revue l'emploi des formes biologiques par divers artistes durant les siècles passés en Europe, et déclare qu'à la fin du dix-neuvième siècle, plusieurs biologistes éminents étaient aussi des artistes. Carl Chun, zoologue de la flore sousmarine, orna sa maison de fresques. L'embryologiste Theodor Boberi réalisa de belles peintures à l'huile représentant des paysages. Heackel et Doflein firent des aquarelles. Durant les décennies qui suivirent, des formes organiques généralisées figurèrent d'une façon importante comme motifs artistiques. Elles furent utilisées, par exemple, par Klee, par Kandinsky, par Gorky, par Tanguy et par Miro. L'interdépendance de l'art et de la science fut assez importante durant ce demi-siècle pour susciter des recherches plus précises que celles qui lui avaient été consacrées jusqu'alors. Plus récemment, le biologiste est devenu plus conscient du caractère de la structure. L'étendue de l'imaginaire s'est réduite depuis que se sont développés des outils d'analyse aussi puissants et scrutateurs que le miscroscope électronique. L'auteur pense que l'étude du comportement et la complexité des relations avec l'environnement pourraient devenir de puissantes zones d'échange entre l'art et la science. La forme, cependant, n'est qu'un aspect, mais combien important, de l'interdépendance entre l'art et la science dans le cadre d'une culture commune."

Adams","Leonardo",5,"3",1972-07-01,"pp. 209-217","10.2307/1572377","The MIT Press","fla","","Geometrical perspective can provide a precise set of rules for the interpretation of a pattern of marks on a plane as a pattern of things in space. A viewer whose vision conforms to these rules will be highly responsive to the picture plane relative to his exact viewpoint. In the first part of the paper, the author examines in detail the responses of a hypothetical viewer sensitive only to the cues of geometrical perspective. In the second half, he describes an experiment on the perception of a perspective checkerboard under nine different conditions. Principal results are: (1) geometrical picture-space, as defined by perspective cues only, varies with the viewer's viewpoint as follows: g = kv, where v is the orthogonal distance from the viewpoint to the picture plane and g is the corresponding depth perceived in the picture-plane; and (2) perceptual picture-space, as determined by the interaction of several perceptual cues, falls substantially short of what a hypothetical 'geometrical man' would see. The loss is greater the greater the expected depth. Contrary to hypothesis, conditions of perceiver viewing, e.g. looking through a pinhole, do not substantially increase accuracy in interpreting linear perspective cues. /// La perspective géométrique peut fournir une série de règles servant à interpreter d'un ensemble de lignes sur un plan représentant un ensemble d'objets dans l'espace. Un observateur dont la vision se conforme à ces règles sera très sensible au contenu du plan de la figure et cette sensibilité dépendra de la localisation exacte de l'oeil de l'observateur. Dans la première partie de cet article, l'auteur examine en détail la réaction d'un observateur hypothétique sensible uniquement aux indications de la perspective géométrique. Dans la seconde partie, il décrit une expérience sur la perception d'un échiquier vu en perspective selon neuf positions différentes. Il en résulte que (1) l'espace pictural géométrique, défini uniquement par les indications de la perspective, varie avec la localisation de l'oeil de l'observateur comme suit: g = kv, v étant la distance orthogonale entre l'oeil de l'observateur et le plan de l'image, et g la profondeur correspondante perçue dans le plan de l'image, et que (2) l'espace pictural perceptif, déterminé par l'interaction de différentes indications de la perception, est bien différent de ce qu'un hypothétique ""homme géométrique"" verrait. Plus cette différence est grande, plus la profondeur prévue est grande. Contrairement à l'hypothèse, les conditions de perception d'un observateur, regardant par exemple à travers un trou d'épingle, ne permettent pas de préciser considérablement l'interprétation des indications de la perspective linéaire."

Sixteen different forms (structural elements) can be generated from this module by rotation, mirror image and by interchanging black and white. Any of these structural elements can be used in each position of a 4 × 4 grid to construct a picture. Areas of the same colour in adjacent structural elements coalesce and lead the eye freely about the picture. In addition to this aspect of the picture, the artist used strong symmetry, which gives 'liveliness' to it. The ideas involved are very vague and the main purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how to render them amenable to computer programming. Firstly, the author subjectively distinguishes 'tracking' movement and 'skipping' movement of the eyes and describes them in detail. Next, these concepts are 'temporarily closed' by definitions. These definitions define a subjective visual model but cannot define the real visual qualities of Barbadillo's pictures. They permit numerical analysis. Eight test pictures of 2 × 2 elements are presented with numerical results that seem plausible. It is hoped that the incorporation of this subjective visual model into a computer programme may enable the generation of pictures controlled by automatic processes of selectivity. /// De 1964 à 1968, Manuel Barbadillo prit pour élément de base de plusieurs de ses tableaux un seul module carré en noir et blanc. Ce module peut engendrer seize formes différentes (ou éléments structuraux) par rotation, par réflexion dans un miroir et par interversion du noir et du blanc. On peut utiliser l'un quelconque de ces éléments structuraux dans n'importe quelle case d'une grille de 4 × 4 pour composer un tableau. Dans des éléments structuraux adjacents, les zones de la même couleur fusionnent et guident librement l'œil sur la surface du tableau. Outre cet aspect du tableau, l'artiste utilisait une forte symétrie, ce qui contribue à la vie de l'œuvre. Les idées impliquées sont très vagues, et l'objet principal de cet article est de montrer comment les programmer sur ordinateur. En premier lieu, l'auteur décrit en détail les mouvements des yeux en distinguant subjectivement ceux qui consistent à ""suivre des yeux"" de ceux qui consistent à ""sauter d'un point à un autre"". Ensuite, ces concepts sont ""momentanément fermés"" par des définitions qui définissent un modèle visuel subjectif, mais ne peuvent définir les qualités visuelles réelles des tableaux de Barbadillo. Ces définitions permettent l'analyse numérique. Huit tableaux-test de 2 × 2 éléments sont présentés avec des résultats numériques qui semblent plausibles. L'auteur espère que l'intégration de ce modèle visuel subjectif à un programme pour ordinateur permettra de produire des tableaux contrôlés par des procédés automatiques de sélection."

Trieschmann","Leonardo",5,"3",1972-07-01,"pp. 227-231","10.2307/1572379","The MIT Press","fla","","Behavioral scientists and physical designers have for some time tried to collaborate. They have failed because physical design is primarily a 'visual thinking' process and behavioral science is not. The expression of this dichotomy is at the bottom of the cultural gap which exists between the two disciplines. In an effort to bridge this gap, the author has sought to develop a methodology that will fit the needs of both the behavioral scientist and physical designer. The process developed, called MERG (Man Environment Response Gram), is a multi-dimensional, non-lineal integration of visually recorded overt behavior with projective statements from the professional designer and subjective responses of users. These three layers of data are abstracted into a single visual medium or MERG, which speaks to the visual thinking process. The first application of MERG (completed by the author in 1969 in a comparative study of open plan schools) indicated that a pattern relationship does exist between human behavior and constructed physical environmental form. This relationship was supported in objective time-lapse photography, in subjective responses from a user sample and in projective graphic abstractions from a designer-researcher. /// Les psychologues du comportement et les dessinateurs fonctionnels ont parfois essayé de collaborer; ils n'y sont pas parvenus car le dessin fonctionnel est principalement un processus de pensée visuelle, ce que n'est pas la science du comportement. Cette dichotomie est à l'origine du fossé qui existe entre ces deux disciplines. Dans un effort pour combler ce fossé, l'auteur a essayé de développer une méthodologie qui satisfaira aussi bien le psycologue du comportement que le dessinateur fonctionnel. Le procédé, appelé MERG (Man Environnement Response Gram) est une intégration multidimensionnelle et non linéaire du comportement visuel actuel avec les explications des dessinateurs professionnels et les réponses subjectives des usagers. Ces trois éléments d'appréciation sont collationnés en un seul moyen visuel ou MERG qui s'adresse au processus de pensée visuelle. La première application du MERG (complétée par l'auteur en 1969 par une étude comparative sur les écoles à plan ouvert) indiquait qu'une relation commune existait bien entre le comportement humain et l'environnement physique des formes construites. Cette relation était basée sur l'objectivité de la photographie avec pose, les réponses subjectives d'un utilisateur expérimental et les graphiques abstraits d'un dessinateur de recherche."

Though the computer can replace man in the production of graphic images, its function in the arts is seen as assisting in the specification of art systems and in their subsequent real-time management. An art of system or process is placed in the context of primarily the visual or plastic arts but the authors disavow concern with any 'new' or 'modern technological' art. Various types of art systems are mentioned and advantages of the fully interactive one are considered. It is pointed out that the inclusion of complex real-time responses in an interactive art system can frequently make use of a computer. In such work, the artist and the viewer play an integral part. The traditional role of the artist, composer or writer is thus called into question; it may no longer be necessary to assume that he is a specialist in art--rather he is a catalyst of creative activity. Three cases are discussed to illustrate the applications of this approach. /// L'avènement de l'informatique exige que l'on reconsidère le problème de la créativité. Bien que l'ordinateur puisse remplacer l'homme dans la production d'images graphiques, on peut penser que sa fonction dans les arts est d'aider à spécifier les systèmes artistiques, et à les répartir ultérieurement dans le temps réel. Un art du système et du processus se situe d'abord dans le contexte des arts visuels ou plastiques; cependant la préoccupation des auteurs n'est d'aucune manière un art 'nouveau' ou 'technologique'. Ils citent plusieurs sortes de systèmes artistiques et décrivent les avantages de celui qui est entièrement 'interactif'. Ils font remarquer que l'inclusion de réponses complexes du temps réel dans un système artistique interactif peut souvent appeler l'utilisation d'un ordinateur. Dans une telle œuvre, l'artiste et le spectateur jouent un rôle à part entière. Le rôle traditionnel de l'artiste, du compositeur ou de l'écrivain est ainsi remis en question; il n'est plus nécessaire d'affirmer que l'artiste est un spécialiste--il est plutôt le catalyseur d'une activité créatrice. Trois exemples illustrent les applications de cette approche."

The investigations follow two directions, the first dealing with a linear system of relationships, the second with square or quadratic systems. The systems exhibit complete sets of combinational relations between four or a multiple of four elements. The original visual elements have been coded, worked with numerically and then retranscribed back into visual form. Computer machinery has been utilized to produce both numerical and visual output. In addition, a variety of other materials and processes have been employed for system manifestation in art works. In each investigation, a geometrical transformation of the initial manifestation generated a second work, which is identical in combinational relations to the first but which is increased in dimension by a factor of one. The author concludes with an observation regarding his working relationship with both the numerical-conceptual and visual-physical systems of the investigations. /// L'auteur décrit l'évolution de ses recherches sur les configurations matricielles.

These investigations have been concerned particularly with the role of clothes and social nudism, body image or one's concept of his or her body, fantasy life, curiosity and dreams. In each investigation, strong differences between males and females have been noted. The most important determinant of extreme looking and showing behavior (called voyeurism and exhibitionism, in pathological cases) is the psychodynamics of the individual. Cultural conditions, however, seem to mediate the expression of this behavior. Thus, when the milieu is repressive, with overtones of severe sexual prohibitions, then pathological or rebellious exhibitionism and voyeurism appear to be manifested. The conclusion drawn from these investigations, based on consistent sexual differences and dominant male visual sexual curiosity, is that the explanation is biological in the Darwinian sense. /// L'auteur a étudié chez les animaux et les êtres humains les conduites de voyeurisme et d'exhibitionisme tant normales que pathologiques. Il a été amené à s'interroger plus particulièrement sur le rôle des vêtements, le nudisme, l'image du corps, le concept que l'on a de son corps, les fantasmes, la curiosité et le rêve. Dans chaque cas, il a noté des différences importantes entre les comportements des mâles et des femelles. La détermination essentielle du voyeurisme et de l'exhibitionisme est la psycho-dynamique individuelle. Cependant les conditions culturelles semblent médiatiser l'expression de ces comportements. Ainsi, dans un milieu répressif comportant de fortes prohibitions sexuelles, l'exhibitionisme et le voyeurisme se manifestent sous des formes rebelles ou pathologiques. A partir de ces investigations ayant pour base les différences entre les sexes et la prédominance de la curiosité visuelle des mâles quant au sexe, l'auteur conclut que l'explication de ces comportements est biologique au sens darwinien du terme."

He discusses the meaning of entropy in thermodynamics, its implications in the realm of the physical universe and the misunderstanding about it that are prevalent among psychologists, aestheticians and artists. Arnheim's book ""Entropy and Art"" is analyzed to show that he fails in his attempts to apply the central metaphor of gestalt psychology of tension reduction in field processes to the interplay of entropy and energy factors in maintaining structure in the world, in particular, in the world of art. The author concludes by stating that artistic, like other human values are not deducible from scientific hypotheses or laws but are assertions of the will. /// L'auteur souligne l'intérêt qu'a pu représenter le concept d'entropie en thermodynamique, en dehors de son application aux sciences de la nature. Il rappelle en particulier comment ce concept a été interprété dans le sens d'une conception philosophique pessimiste de la vie. Il explique le sens de l'entropie en thermodynamique et ses implications dans le domaine de l'univers physique, ainsi que les erreurs d'interprétation à ce sujet qui se sont répandues chez les psychologues, les esthéticiens et les artistes. Il analyse le livre d'Arnheim, ""Entropy and Art,"" pour montrer que ce dernier n'a pas atteint son but. Ce but était d'appliquer la métaphore centrale de la psychologie de la forme (gestaltiste), à savoir la réduction de tension dans le champ d'expérience, à l'effet réciproque de l'entropie et des facteurs énergétiques tendant à maintenir une structure de l'univers, en particulier du monde artistique. L'auteur en affirmant que les valeurs artistiques, de même que les autres valeurs humaines, ne peuvent être déduites d'hypothèses scientifiques, mais sont au contraire des affirmations de la volonté."

He discusses a series of hybrid types that concern him particularly. Reference is made to particular types of imagery and their effects, such as the feelings of direction, movement and expansion. The effects of repetition and the use of grids are discussed. He points out that grids can be employed to emphasize imagery and to give the feeling of the passage of time. In the concluding section, the author outlines the use of grid structures in Western art, beginning with functional purposes from the time of Ancient Egypt to the Renaissance, and their aesthetic application up to the present. /// L'auteur développe une conception de l'unité dans les compositions qui comportent des combinaisons (hybrides) d'éléments picturaux soit différents soit semblables.

He briefly reviews the origins of abstract art and discusses reaction to it in the U.S.A. He describes his own experience with abstract painting, which began in 1935 in Chicago, and shows examples of his paintings. He points out that American Abstract Expressionism of the nineteen-forties and 'fifties merges into history as an intrinsic part of the evolution of the international art movement; nevertheless, at the time it was thought to be one of the few manifestations of total originality in art history. He analyses the background to the works of Ad Reinhardt and Burgoyne Diller, in particular the 'black' paintings of Rienhardt's last period. He concludes by giving his outlook on the future as regards the emerging younger generation's commitment to the dynamism of computer age technology. /// Selon l'auteur, parmi les divers styles et tendances en peinture qui ont marqué le vingtième siècle, seuls les peintres abstraits ou non-figuratifs ont tenté d'épurer la surface peinte de tous les éléments excepté les qualités exclusivement visuelles. Il rappelle brièvement les origines de l'art abstrait et les réactions qu'il a suscitées aux Etats-Unis. Il décrit sa propre expérience de l'art abstrait, qui commença en 1935 à Chicago, et donne des exemples de ses tableaux. Il fait remarquer que l'Expressionisme Abstrait Américain des années dix-neuf cent quarante et cinquante s'intègre dans l'histoire comme une étape dans l'évolution du mouvement artistique international, bien qu'il ait été considéré a l'époque comme une des rares manifestations de véritable originalité dans l'histoire de l'art. Il analyse le contexte culturel des œuvres de Ad Reinhardt et de Burgoyne Diller, en particulier des peintures 'noires' de la dernière période de Reinhardt.

In works of art, there is also an interlocking of space and time, however, she points out that it does not involve problems of relativistic physics. She outlines the temporal and spatial aspects of music and of different kinds of visual art, such as static painting and sculpture, Op art and kinetic art. The differences between objective space and time, and psychological space and time are discussed as they pertain to these arts. She concludes that it is not correct to classify music as simply a 'temporal' art and the visual arts as 'spatial' arts, for in both of these art forms there is an interrelationship between time and space. /// L'auteur remarque que le concept d'interdépendence entre l'espace et le temps est l'un des points les plus passionnants de la physique et de la philosophie contemporaines. Dans les œuvres d'art, il y a aussi interdépendance entre l'espace et le temps; elle note cependant que ces problèmes sont distincts de ceux de la physique relativiste. Elle mentionne les aspects temporels et spatiaux de la musique et des différentes sortes d'art visuel comme la peinture statique et la sculpture, l'Op art et l'art cinétique. La différence entre l'espace et le temps objectifs et l'espace et le temps psychologiques est discutée dans le cadre de ces différentes formes d'art.

They are proposed when people are dissatisfied with their mode of life. Realizable ones depend upon availability of appropriate technology and upon the existence of general agreement in a society for its implementation. In the study, examples of utopias that might be attained are outlined. The concept of a non-paternalistic utopia is explained as one in which decisions are not imposed on individuals but each one can design his own utopia. A method for describing the relations in an environment of individuals and objects is given by means of which forecasts can be made on the response of the environment to an individual's act. He calls the study of non-paternalistic models of utopia social ecology and stresses the point that it differs from classical ecology in that social ecology is goal-oriented rather than merely concerned with random aspects of the natural environment. /// L'auteur fait remarquer que les projets utopiques mettent en jeu un environnement composé de personnes et d'objets. Ils sont proposés lorsque les gens ne sont pas satisfaits de leur mode de vie. Ceux qui sont réalisables dépendent de l'existence de techniques appropriées et d'un consensus général de la société pour être mis en œuvre. Dans cette étude, des exemples d'utopies qui pourraient être atteintes sont donnés. Le concept d'utopie non-paternaliste est expliqué: il implique que les décisions ne sont pas imposées aux individus, mais que chacun peut forger sa propre utopie. L'auteur expose une méthode de description des relations dans un environnement d'individus et d'objets, méthode qui permet de faire des prévisions sur la réponse de l'environnement à un acte individuel. Il appelle l'étude des modèles non-paternalistes d'utopies l'écologie sociale, et souligne le fait qu'elle diffère de l'écologie classique en ce que l'écologie sociale est orientée vers un but, et non pas uniquement intéressée par des aspects aléatoires de l'environnement naturel."

As a young artist, he noted that plastic art had been dissected and he concluded that it was necessary to reunite the parts. He set as one of his objectives the surpassing of individual style. He discusses certain elements of his work that have been of special concern to him during the past few years. The first concerns the representation of reality by drawing and watercolour painting where shapes relate only partly to pre-conceived structures. The second concerns his style where he requires equal weight be given to different forms and to different colors in a picture. The third and fourth relate to art materials he uses and to the vibrant color combinations in his paintings. The fifth centers on his interest for variability, which he obtains by providing transformable arrays of painted panels. /// L'auteur rend compte de son évolution artistique, et en particulier de l'élaboration de ses objectifs en dessin et en peinture. Quand il était un jeune artiste, il constata que le domaine des arts plastiques avait été scindé, et en conclut que sa réunification était nécessaire. Il posa comme l'un de ses buts le dépassement du style individuel. Il expose certains aspects de son œuvre qui l'ont particulièrement préoccupé durant ces dernières années. Le premier est la représentation de la réalité par le dessin et la peinture à l'aquarelle, représentation dans laquelle les formes n'ont qu'un rapport partiel à des structures préétablies. Le second concerne son style qui veut qu'un poids égal soit donné aux différentes formes et aux différentes couleurs d'un tableau. Le troisième et le quatrième ont trait aux matériaux artistiques qu'il utilise et aux combinaisons de couleurs vibrantes de ses peintures. Enfin le cinquième est fondé sur son intérêt pour la variabilité, qu'il obtient en fournissant des assemblages transformables de panneaux peints."

Traditionally, art is taught in individual subjects but the proposed training is integrative, a concept usually reserved for training advanced students. The course, in line with the painter's process, alternates constantly between freedom and control. The professional, after years of trial and error, is able to juggle and integrate all of the visual elements at one time--colors, shapes, light and dark values, lines and textures. Mastering this difficult integrative process is made possible for the amateur by limiting the media and techniques, stripping the procedures to the minimum and organizing their sequence. Control is established by confining attention to one visual element at a time and building one upon the other. The proposed training advances by means of an integrated interplay between work from the imagination, analysis of the works of masters and critical examination of student work. Three-dimensional factors are purposely postponed until the two-dimensional process is mastered. Concurrently, amateur preconceptions and prejudices are faced squarely to develop objective judgment and artistic taste. /// L'auteur propose une formule nouvelle de cours de formation qui permet à des amateurs adultes débutants n'ayant ni passé ni talent artistique particuliers, de faire l'expérience d'une forme simplifiée du processus synthétique de la création artistique chez le peintre. Traditionnellement, on enseigne l'art par sujets particuliers; il s'agit au contraire ici d'une formation synthétique, concept généralement réservé aux étudiants avancés. Ce cours, parallèlement à la démarche du peintre, oscille constamment entre la liberté et le contrôle. Le professionnel, après des années d'essais et d'erreurs, est capable à la fois de jongler avec tous les éléments visuels en même temps--couleurs, formes, ombres et lumières, lignes et textures--et de les synthétiser. Il est possible à l'amateur de maîtriser ce difficile processus de synthèse si on limite le nombre des matériaux, qu'on réduit au minimum les différents procédés et qu'on organise leur succession temporelle. Il faut fixer l'attention sur un seul élément visuel à la fois, et élaborer ainsi progressivement la construction de l'oeuvre. Cette initiation progresse par un jeu réciproque d'assimilation entre le travail de l'imagination, l'analyse d'oeuvres de maîtres et l'examen critique du travail des étudiants. Les facteurs tri-dimensionnels ne sont abordés que lorsque le processus bi-dimensionnel est parfaitement maîtrisé. En même temps, les a priori et les préjugés de l'amateur doivent être envisagés sans complaisance pour développer le jugement objectif et le goût artistique."

Up to now digital and analog computers have been used that were originally designed for scientific and technical purposes, and they are adequate for the artistic task but their output still proves to be a bottleneck. A further difficulty arises from the fact that aesthetic theories suitable as a base for computer art are still in their infancy. The use of computers means breaking with some art traditions but, on the other hand, it may well lead to a breakthrough in art and a better, rational understanding of artistic phenomena. /// L'art graphique par calculatrices est une conséquence logique de l'art graphique obtenu avec des machines plus simples ou par le calcul. On a utilisé des ordinateurs et des calculateurs analogiques initialement destinés à un usage scientifique ou technique; or, s'ils conviennent à cette tâche artistique, leur rendement est encore un blocage.

Loeb","Leonardo",4,"4",1971-10-01,"pp. 339-346","10.2307/1572505","The MIT Press","fla","","The author points out that art is concerned with the ordering of space; whatever the nature of the order or disorder may be, a work of art is the result of decisions on the part of the artist regarding the juxtaposition of entities, be they colored points or artifacts previously designed for a different purpose, as in collages. The structure of a pattern expresses the relations between the elements of a pattern, which the author demonstrates. The scientist searches for patterns and relations among observations; to this purpose he systematizes his observations. This systematization in exhaustively exploring all possible combinations of juxtapositions can expand the repertoire of the artist beyond the bounds of the rectangularity that has unfortunately left such a confining imprint on Western civilization. /// L'auteur fait remarquer que l'agencement spatial fait partie des préoccupations artistiques; quelle que soit la nature de l'ordre ou du désordre, une œuvre d'art est le résultat de décisions de l'artiste concernant la juxtaposition d'entités, qu'il s'agisse de points de couleur ou d'artefacts antérieurement conçus pour un usage différent, comme dans les collages. La structure d'un configuration est l'expression des relations entre les éléments du configuration, comme le montre l'auteur. Le savant cherche des modèles et les relations entre des observations; dans ce but, il systématise ses observations. Cette systématisation, parce qu'elle explore de manière exhaustive toutes les combinaisons possibles de juxtaposition, peut étendre le répertoire de l'artiste au-delà des limites de la rectangularité, qui a malheureusement marqué la civilisation occidentale de son empreinte restrictive et contraignante."

The availability of clear polymethyl methacrylate (an acrylic synthetic resin), slabs of which can be bonded to make large blocks, led him to use this material for transparent sculpture beginning in 1968. Although the main property that originally attracted him to this acrylic resin is its optical clarity, he finds it alone is of limited aesthetic significance. When the eye is attracted to a shape in clear acrylic resin, this is to a great extent due to the object's brilliance. This brilliance is present only when light is reflected from the object's internal and external surfaces, as from mirrors, to the observer. He concludes that reflection and transparency should be added as separate entities to the generally accepted concepts of sculptural form. /// Ayant été inspiré par des sculptures orientales en cristal de roche transparent, l'auteur tenta de ciseler cette sorte de quartz, mais sans succès en raison de son exceptionnelle dureté. La disponibilité de polyméthacrylate de méthyle (une résine acrylique synthétique) limpide, dont des plaques peuvent être assemblées de manière à constituer de grands blocs, l'amena à partir de 1968 à utiliser ce matériau pour faire des sculptures transparentes. Bien que la principale propriété qui l'attirât à l'origine dans cette résine acrylique fût sa clarté optique, il trouve qu'elle n'a en soi que peu de signification esthétique. Quand l'oeil est attiré par une forme en résine acrylique transparente, c'est en grande partie dû au brillant de l'objet. Cet éclat n'existe que lorsque la lumière est réfléchie par les surfaces internes et externes de l'objet, comme par des miroirs, et renvoyée au spectateur. L'auteur conclut que la réflexion de la lumière et la transparence devraient s'ajouter en tant qu'entités indépendantes aux autres concepts traditionnels désignant la forme sculpturale."

The relations between philosophy and art in the past are contrasted with the separation existing between the arts, aesthetics and science, and between contemporary artists and aestheticians. The heart of the dilemma for aesthetics is pointed out as being the multiplicity of styles that have emerged during this century. Some of the reasons for the existence of so many styles are discussed. The debate that has been going on in ""Leonardo"" between aestheticians and artists is summarized and commented upon. Important issues that warrant aesthetic investigation are brought out. The influence of aesthetic hypotheses on the author's own work as a painter is described. She concludes that perhaps it is not aesthetics as a theorizing discipline that the contemporary artist refuses to take seriously but rather many of today's aestheticians. /// L'auteur souligne le rôle majeur de l'art dans la société et l'importance des relations entre une œuvre d'art, son créateur et le public.

Les importantes questions qui justifient l'investigation esthétique sont posées. L'influence des hypothèses esthétiques sur sa propre œuvre en tant que peintre est décrite par l'auteur. Elle conclut que ce n'est pas l'esthétique en tant que théorie que l'artiste contemporain refuse de prendre sérieusement en considération, mais plutôt certains esthéticiens professionels d'aujourd'hui."

He analyzes several examples of artists' works made in the past and in the present to show that the illusionistic doctrine is not well suited for dealing with formal features that contradict the optical projection of three-dimensional objects on a pictorial surface. He points out how such formal features enhance visual display and expression, which are the basic objectives of picture-making. /// L'auteur attire l'attention sur l'intérêt de la perspective inverse en ce qu'elle peut servir à illustrer deux manières fondamentalement différentes d'interpréter la forme picturale, et en ce qu'elle a trouvé dans l'art du vingtième siècle des applications nouvelles.

Il précise comment de tels éléments formels mettent en valeur la manifestation visuelle et l'expression, qui sont les objectifs fondamentaux de la création picturale."

The contrasting responses of individuals and their interaction within group situations became a focus of concern on both pedagogic and artistic levels.

In 'The Back of this Painting' type of project, individual contributions attained a connection with each other through their relationship to the common environment of the studio. 'Advanced Blue When Flashing' involved work as a group in the final stages but others, such as 'Checker-board System', 'End of a Losing Trip', 'Still Life with Fruit', 'Woods I' and 'Woods II', were executed independently but according to principles that enabled their assemblage in a larger whole on completion. The 'Woods I' project and the final stages of the 'Advanced Blue When Flashing' project solicited aesthetic decisions of a fundamental nature. Most other projects were concerned with the structuring of information. /// L'application de principes subjectifs dans l'enseignement de l'auteur a fait apparaître une nouvelle direction de recherche artistique.

His outlook is the result of painting for many years representational landscapes of the planets of the solar system. He describes the problems he has encountered in making such paintings. He defends his conviction that paintings of this kind still have value, in spite of close-up photographs now available of the lunar surface and better ones of Mars than could be obtained before the space age by means of telescopes on the Earth. Furthermore, he continues to obtain aesthetic inspiration from extraterrestrial sources. /// L'auteur rend compte de l'imprécision des termes moderne et liberté d'une manière générale, et plus particulièrement quand ils s'appliquent au domaine artistique.

He has constructed simple sculptural mobiles for use as moving subjects for photography. These static images on photographic prints or slides he calls metaforms. Simple forms made of wire, paper, wood, etc. suspended by a thread and forms suspended in a manner of some of Calder's well known mobiles are preferred. A wide range of metaforms may be achieved by varying the design of the mobile, its kind of motion and speed, and the photographic technique. He also makes a form of kinetic art with cinematographic film and with the diaprojection of series of metaforms. The author feels that an analogy between metaforms and music can be found. He has begun collaboration with a musician on the simultaneous composition of music and metaforms for diaprojection. /// L'auteur explique comment il a cherché à exprimer le mouvement dans ses photographies. Il construit des mobiles pour les photographier en mouvement. Il appelle 'Métaformes' les images qu'il obtient ainsi en photographies ou en diapositives. Ces mobiles sont des sculptures très simples faites de fil de fer, de papier, de bois, etc., et suspendues par des fils comme certains mobiles bien connus de Calder. En jouant sur la forme du mobile, sa vitesse et son mouvement, et sur la technique photographique il peut obtenir des métaformes très différentes. Il réalise aussi une sorte d'art cinétique avec des films et des montages de diapositives de ses métaformes. L'auteur pense qu'il existe une analogie entre les métaformes et la musique.

The high points of his architectural career are mentioned from the points of view of the use of sculpture in architecture and of architecture as sculpture. Jacobsen whenever possible insisted on having control of the overall concept of a building, including interior design and decoration, and landscaping. He brought in consultants at an early stage of each project to advise him on the use of sculpture and on other aspects making up a complete building. His own interest in design ranged from kitchen and bathroom fittings to tableware to machinery to book covers. Some felt that to achieve his target Jacobsen developed a cold manner in order to dictate to clients the precise environment in which they were to work or live. The author disputes this and says Jacobsen was regarded by all who knew him well as a considerate, gentle and warm-hearted person. /// L'auteur a effectué une étude de l'œuvre de l'architecte danois Arne Jacobsen, avec qui il travailla durant les années qui précédèrent sa mort. Il rappelle les grands moments de sa carrière d'architecte en montrant à la fois l'utilisation qu'il faisait de la sculpture en architecture, et l'usage de l'architecture comme sculpture. Pour Jacobsen, le plus important était de maîtriser dans sa totalité le concept d'une construction, y compris la conception et la décoration intérieure, et l'environnement. Au début de chaque projet, il demandait à des experts de le conseiller sur l'utilisation des sculptures, et sur d'autres aspects nécessaires à la réalisation intégrale d'un bâtiment. Il s'intéressait personnellement tout autant aux installations de cuisines et de salles de bain qu'à la conception des pièces de vaisselle, à la machinerie ou aux reliures de livres. Certains eurent le sentiment que pour atteindre son but, Jacobsen affichait une certaine froideur afin d'imposer à ses clients l'environnement précis dans lequel ils allaient devoir travailler ou vivre.

Marzio","Leonardo",5,"4",1972-10-01,"pp. 315-324","10.2307/1572586","The MIT Press","fla","","The author points out that one of the unique characteristics of fine art since 1910 has been the acceptance of technology and machines as viable subjects for painters and sculptors. This interest developed at a time when middle class homes, particularly in America, began receiving a host of electrical appliances. Much of this new art of technology was highly satirical, often in sympathy with the invention cartoons of the American, Rube Goldberg. In fact, some artists, particularly Duchamp, were inspired by the Goldberg cartoons. Both the Goldberg inventions and some of the fine art works produced since 1910 follow a style of satire described by Sigmund Freud. They also point out some of the basic characteristics of modern technology that most observers have failed to see. /// L'auteur remarque que l'une des seules caractéristiques des beaux arts depuis 1910 a été la reconnaissance de la technologie et des machines en tant que thèmes d'inspiration pour les peintres et les sculpteurs. Ce sujet d'intérêt s'est imposé lorsque les logements de la petite bourgeoisie ont commencé à être équipés d'appareils électriques, aux Etats-Unis en particulier. Une grande partie de ces nouvelles formes d'art liées à la technologie était fortement satirique, et dénotait une attitude similaire à celle de l'Américain Rube Goldberg dans ses bandes dessinées ayant pour thème des inventions techniques. Certains artistes comme Duchamp furent en fait directement inspirés par les bandes dessinées de Goldberg. Les inventions de Goldberg et certaines œuvres d'art produites à partir de 1910 ont ce style satirique qui a été décrit par Sigmund Freud. Elles mettent également en évidence certains des traits fondamentaux de la technologie moderne que la plupart des commentateurs n'ont pas vus."
"10.2307/1572587","Violence and Caprice in Recent Art","Lincoln Rothschild","Leonardo",5,"4",1972-10-01,"pp. 325-328","10.2307/1572587","The MIT Press","fla","","Destruction of traditional forms by contemporary art is generally justified as either modern or revolutionary. A recent article in ""Leonardo"" weakens the first of these characterizations by suggesting parallels with the anal stage of early childhood resistance to parental authority. However, the author points out that reference to the history of art shows that violence and caprice are favored for other reasons by those who are interested politically in maintaining the status quo. The art of revolutionaries, on the other hand, tends to deal rather with specific problems that arise from decadence and privilege, in a manner that suggests solutions or at least focuses with hopeful emphasis on prevailing social values. In conclusion, the author suggests that the integrated processes of technology and industrial production, heretofore largely ignored as a subject for artistic concern and misinterpreted by presumably sympathetic liberalism, might supply worthy subject matter for an art of true contemporary interest and effective social hygiene. /// On qualifie généralement la destruction des formes traditionnelles dans l'art contemporain soit de moderne, soit de révolutionnaire. Un article récemment publié dans ""Leonardo"" affaiblit la portée de la première de ces désignations en établissant un parallèle avec le stade anal de l'enfance exprimant la résistance à l'autorité parentale. Quoi qu'il en soit, l'auteur remarque que si l'on se réfère à l'histoire de l'art, on voit que la violence et le caprice sont privilégiés pour d'autres raisons par ceux qui ont intérêt à maintenir le statu quo en politique. Au contraire l'art des révolutionnaires tend à traiter plutôt des problèmes spécifiques qu'entraînent la décadence et les privilèges, de manière à suggérer des solutions, ou au moins à mettre en avant la prédominance des valeurs sociales. En conclusion, l'auteur avance que l'assimilation des processus de la technologie et de la production industrielle qui ont été jusqu'à présent largement ignorés par le champ artistique et mal compris en raison d'une sympathie trop libérale, pourrait bien constituer une matière très riche pour un art présentant véritablement un intérêt actuel et une hygiène sociale réelle."

To introduce the student into the world of three dimensions, the assignments start with reliefs, which are an extension of two-dimensional expression. The different tasks that follow are divided between those that call upon the imagination and those that require a model. Space, movement and expression are stressed. The author warns against letting students do too much craft-type work, because he sees a distinct difference between enrichment of conception through creative work in three-dimensions and repetitious concentration on developing manual skills. The materials used range from clay, plaster, Styrofoam slabs and wire to stone and wood. The aim of the course is to introduce students to three-dimensional art, in order to counteract the influence of the mass media, such as photography, cinema and television, which tend to have a 'flattening' influence on people. /// L'auteur organise un cours élémentaire de sculpture bâti autour d'une succession méthodique de travaux distincts. Pour acclimater l'étudiant au monde tri-dimensionnel, les premiers travaux sont des reliefs constituant un prolongement de l'expression bi-dimensionnelle. Ensuite, viennent des études mettant l'accent sur l'espace, le mouvement et l'expression: d'une part celles qui font appel à l'imagination, d'autre part celles qui sont réalisées à partir d'un modéle. Le but poursuivi étant l'enrichissement de l'expression artistique, l'auteur souligne qu'il peut être dangereux de laisser les étudiants se consacrer trop au perfectionnement de leur dextérité; en effet il existe pour lui une nette différence entre un travail créatif intégrant la réalité tri-dimensionnelle et la concentration répétitive sur le développement de la seule habileté manuelle. L'éventail des différents matériaux utilisés va de l'argile, du plâtre, des plaques de Styrofoam et du fil de fer, à la pierre et au bois. Le but du cours est d'initier les étudiants à l'art tri-dimensionnel, et par là, de contrer l'influence des mass-media (photographie, cinéma, télévision) qui tendent à donner au public une vision 'aplatie' de la réalité."

Emphasis is on the art experience as a pattern for creativity regardless of professional commitment. The perspective of history, an appraisal of art/technology trends and the challenge of relevance confronting art today serve to confirm the need for joining artistic and scientific perceptions. It is pointed out that scientists and engineers could contribute significantly to meeting this challenge by applying their knowledge and skills in the search for visual form of 20th-century relevance. /// En nous rapportant cette expérience pédagogique, l'auteur nous dit ce qu'il pense du rôle des arts visuels dans la formation des scientifiques et des ingénieurs. L'expérience artistique est la plupart du temps présentée comme un modèle pour la créativité qui n'aurait que peu de rapport avec la vie professionnelle. La nécessité de relier les modes de perception artistiques et scientifiques se trouve confirmée par la perspective historique, par l'appréciation du rapport entre l'art et la technologie et par le défi que ce même rapport lance à l'art. Chaque jour il devient plus évident que scientifiques et ingénieurs pourraient contribuer de façon significative à relever ce défi en appliquant leurs connaissances et leur habilété manuelle à la recherche de formes visuelles propre au XXo siècle. Les objectifs et les méthodes appliqués par l'auteur dans son cours (en atelier), se définissent par rapport à cette thèse. La promotion de l'expérience artistique dans une communauté scientifique encourage les étudiants à employer les moyens de communication et les techniques propres à leur discipline plutôt que les méthodes traditionnellement dévolues aux beaux arts et aux arts appliqués. Des exemples de leurs recherches en matière de formes artistiques montrent à l'évidence que l'art est compatible avec la science et la technique dans le processus d'apprentissage. La démonstration est ainsi faite que la plupart des disciplines se rattachant à la physique ou aux sciences appliquées ont un rôle à jouer quant à l'innovation en matière de formes visuelles."

As regards the forming of the plastic, he particularly describes methods of twisting and bending the material when it is softened by heating. He does not employ casting techniques, which consist of making plastic sculpture in a mold from the monomer, because the technical difficulties and expense preclude optically satisfactory massive castings. He describes in detail his making of a recent piece entitled 'Implication' that has a body of smoky transparent Plexiglas mounted on an anodized aluminum base. His principal aim in making acrylic sculpture is the preservation and extension of the marvellous capacity of Plexiglas to activate light aesthetically. /// L'auteur présente tout d'abord, brièvement la philosophie sous jascente à son œuvre, puis il explique pourquoi il utilise en sculpture de la résine acrylique ou polyméthacrylate de méthyle (Plexiglas), compte tenu de ses qualités optiques. En ce qui concerne la façon dont il travaille le plastique, il décrit plus particulièrement les différentes manières de le tordre et de le plier une fois ramolli par la chaleur. Il n'emploie pas le moulage, qui consiste à fabriquer la sculpture de plastique dans un moule à partir du monomère, en raison des difficultés techniques et du coût qui ne permettent pas la réalisation de moulages massifs optiquement satisfaisants. Ensuite, il décrit en détail les moyens qu'il a employés pour réaliser une piéce récente intitulée 'Implication' possédant un corps de Plexiglas fumé et transparent monté sur un socle d'aluminium électrolysé. En exécutant ce type de sculpture acrylique, il a surtout voulu préserver et étendre la merveilleuse capacité du Plexiglas à mettre en valeur esthétiquement la lumiére."

The steps that have been taken by the proponents of these two approaches to democratize art are reviewed, as well as the results so far obtained. He concludes that popularism has but little affected the elitist structure and the financing of the art establishment, which is more heavily in debt than ever before; the public seems to have become more confused about art than enlightened and the situation of artists has not been improved. On the other hand, populism tends to lead to over-optimism as to the possibility of overcoming social and economic realities and of solving the problems of maintaining the quality of the works of visual fine art. Nevertheless, he believes that populism cannot be dismissed because it represents very real dissatisfactions by important components of the American art world. /// L'auteur rend compte de l'apparition sur la scène des arts plastiques aux Etats-Unis, vers 1950, du popularisme (une vulgarisation de la conception élitiste de l'art) et, dans les années 60, du populisme (une approche égalitariste des artistes, de leurs oeuvres et du public). Il passe en revue aussi bien les différentes démarches que les résultats obtenus par les tenants de ces deux courants tendant à démocratiser l'art. Il en conclut que le popularisme n'a que peu affecté la structure élitiste et le mode de financement des institutions artistiques qui sont plus endettées que jamais; le public semble plus embrouillé qu'éclairé sur les questions artistiques, et la situation des artistes ne s'est pas améliorée. D'autre part, le populisme tend à favoriser un optimisme excessif en ce qui concerne la possibilité de surmonter les réalités économiques et sociales et de maintenir la qualité des oeuvres d'art. Néanmoins il pense qu'on ne peut ignorer le populisme, car il reflète le très réel mécontentement de fractions importantes du monde artistique américain."
"10.2307/1572641","Urban Sculpture: A Kind of Therapy","Peter F. Smith","Leonardo",6,"3",1973-07-01,"pp. 227-232","10.2307/1572641","The MIT Press","fla","","The author points out that modern environment in its many aspects (phenomenal, social and technological) is creating what has been called 'culture shock'. Man is being subjected in his daily life to uncertainties and changes that lie beyond his optimum perceptual rate. At the same time, urban environment is being constructed that offers no nourishment to the mind. New construction replacing older buildings invariably manifests a sharp drop in density of interest. The result is a tendency for people to operate within an environment on an increasingly subliminal level of awareness. The mechanics of the brain and its preference for system-maximization give discreet support to this tendency. He believes that the importance of urban design is that it can offer mental stimulation at a level compatible with the optimum perceptual rate, so that the mind does not withdraw, either because of monotony or of sensory overload. To this end, sculpture has a vital role to play, because of its intrinsic interest and its testament to values other than pure utilitarianism. It raises the visual interest of a place, it undermines the incipient tendency of the mind to capitulate to system-maximization. He gives examples of the effective use of sculpture in an urban setting in Europe in the past and in the present. /// Pour l'auteur l'environnement moderne par ses differents aspects (phénoménal, social, technologique), est en train de créer ce qu'on a appelé un 'choc culturel'. Dans sa vie quotidienne, l'homme est soumis à des incertitudes et à des changements qui dépassent son seuil optimum de perception. En même temps, se développe un environnement urbain où l'esprit ne peut trouver matière à s'épanouir. Les vieux bâtiments sont progressivement remplacés par de nouveaux dont l'architecture ne suscite que peu d'intêret. Tout cela se concrètise chez l'homme par une tendance à réagir à l'interieur de cet environnement de façon de plus en plus inconsciente. Cette inclination est favorisée par les mécanismes propre du cerveau et sa préference pour les systématisations maximales. L'auteur pense que l'importance de l'urbanisme vient de ce qu'il peut offrir des stimulations mentales à un niveau compatible avec le seuil de perception optimum, de telle sorte que la conscience n'a pas tendance à abdiquer, que ce soit en raison de la monotonie ambiante ou d'une sensibilité atténuée parceque trop surmenée. A cette fin la sculpture a un rôle vital à jouer en fonction de son intêret propre, mais aussi de son message qui donne la priorité à d'autres valeurs que le simple utilitarisme. La sculpture ressuscite l'intérêt visuel d'un lieu, elle combat la tendance naissante de l'esprit à s'abandonner à la systématisation maximale. L'auteur donne des exemples de l'utilisation effective de la sculpture dans une ville européenne, aussi bien dans le passé qu'aujourd'hui."

The exhibitions dealt with the subjects of 'War' (1969), 'Work' (1970), 'Worship' (1971) and 'Sex' (1973). In connection with these exhibitions, the author, alone or with a co-author, has written books on these subjects. He points out that a new model of culture is needed to replace the 'aristocratic' one of culture moving from a 'high' to a 'low' level of society. The exhibitions and the books, therefore, were designed to be deliberately entertaining and to make clear the functional interdependence of art and life. They brashly confront the public with ephemera-like seaside postcards or patriotic corsets from World War I alongside painting and sculpture. He concludes by saying that either a fluid, broadening definition of art related to the mass media of today as well as to the aristocratic media of the past must be developed or the continued use of a narrow concept that will become steadily more remote from the cultural questions of a technological world must be accepted. /// L'auteur justifie l'approche particulière en matière de critique et de popularisation qui a servi à la préparation de la série d'expositions sur 'l'art et la société' organisée par le Welsh Arts Council. Ces expositions avaient pour thèmes 'La guerre' (1969), 'Le travail' (1970), 'Le culte' (1971) et 'Le sexe' (1973). Parallèlement à ces expositions, l'auteur, seul ou avec l'aide d'un co-auteur, a écrit des livres sur ces thèmes. Il met en évidence le besoin d'un nouveau modèle de culture qui remplacerait le modèle aristocratique selon lequel la culture se propage des couches supérieures de la société vers les couches inférieures. Les expositions et les livres furent donc délibérément conçus dans un but à la fois distrayant et intéressant pour tous, tendant à souligner l'interdépendance fonctionnelle de l'art et de la vie. Ils permettent une confrontation brutale du public avec des réalités éphémères telles que des cartes postales de paysages marins ou des corsets patriotiques de la première guerre mondiale, présentés à côté de tableaux et de sculptures. L'auteur conclut en affirmant qu'il faut choisir entre d'une part le développement d'une définition largement ouverte de l'art, en relation avec les techniques modernes de communication et d'information, mais aussi avec les moyens aristocratiques traditionnels de l'art, et d'autre part le maintien d'un concept étroit qui répondra de moins en moins aux questions culturelles posées par notre monde technologique."

He may concern himself with (1) the pleasures or satisfactions to be derived from immediate sense experience of a work of art, or (2) the admiration (or disesteem) that is properly due to a work of art. These have led to two types of art criticism that he calls experience-directed and object-directed. He discusses the weakness of experience-directed criticism by stressing the unavailability of private entities ('inner experiences') for public scrutiny and rational discussion. On the other hand, he finds that object-directed criticism, conducted in terms of admiration and the grounds of admiration, may include that part of experience-directed criticism that deals in discussable matters. He concludes by saying that, from a beholders point of view, understanding a critic's attitudes and presuppositions is not necessarily an alternative to understanding the work itself; the critic may provide a way to understand it. /// L'auteur remarque que le critique d'art doit choisir entre deux attitudes. Il peut prendre en considération (1) ou bien le plaisir ou la satisfaction provenant de l'expérience sensible immédiate d'une oeuvre d'art (2) ou bien l'admiration (ou le mépris) que doit effectivement inspirer l'oeuvre d'art. Cette alternative a entraîné deux différents types de critique d'art, que l'auteur appelle d'une part 'fondée sur l'expérience', et d'autre part 'fondée sur l'objet'. Il commente la faiblesse de la méthode critique fondée sur l'expérience en soulignant l'invalidité des entités individuelles ('expériences intérieures') par rapport à l'observation d'autrui, et dans le domaine de l'étude rationelle. Au contraire, il pense que la méthode critique fondée sur l'objet même, exprimée en termes d'admiration et s'appuyant sur les causes de cette admiration, peut également rendre raison de ce qui, dans la critique fondée sur l'expérience, constitue des assertions discutables. Il conclut en affirmant que, du point de vue du spectateur, la compréhension de l'attitude et des présupposés de critique n'empêche pas nécessairement la compréhension de l'oeuvre elle-même; le critique peut très bien aider à cette compréhension."

The changing attitudes of artists to photography and the ethical problem of giving credit to photographers is discussed. /// L'auteur rappelle que les photographies ont été utilisées principalement de trois manières dans le domaine des arts plastiques: (1) comme une source de référence dans la création d'objets d'art, particulièrement des tableaux, (2) comme éléments incorporés dans des objets d'art et (3) en tant que documents reproduisant des œuvres d'art.

Jerome","Leonardo",6,"2",1973-04-01,"pp. 121-130","10.2307/1572687","The MIT Press","fla","","The author states that there can be no scientific validity in the methods and predictions of astrology, since astrology originated as a magical system and the passage of some 6000 years has not altered the fallacious assumptions upon which it rests. He discusses the pre-historic roots of astrology and its development and role in societies during historical times. Astrological axioms are analyzed and shown to be based upon the magical principle of correspondences and thus can have no validity in terms of modern science. He reviews present-day scientific studies of the influence of celestial bodies on the Earth and on the behavior of living organisms, for example, the still controversial subject of biological clocks. However, he stresses that these studies give no support to the claims of astrology. He concludes his article with a summary of efforts made to find support for the predictions of astrology by means of statistical methods. In particular, he concentrates upon the recent studies by Gauquelin relating the choice of professions with planetary positions. He demonstrates that Gauquelin has committed the error of finding cause and effect between phenomena which only accidentally happen to occur at the same time and of omitting critically important known physical facts. /// L'auteur affirme que les méthodes et les prédictions astrologiques ne peuvent avoir aucune validité scientifique, puisque l'astrologie est à l'origine un système magique et que bien que 6000 années se soient écoulées, cela n'a en rien modifié les postulats fallacieux sur lesquels elle repose. Il rappelle les racines préhistoriques de l'astrologie, son développement et son rôle dans les sociétés au cours de l'histoire. Il analyse les axiomes de l'astrologie et montre qu'ils ont pour fondement le principe magique des correspondances, et que par conséquent ils ne peuvent être considérés comme valides aux yeux de la science moderne. Il passe en revue les études scientifiques actuelles ayant trait à l'influence des corps célestes sur la terre et sur le comportement des organismes vivants; il donne comme exemple la question encore controversée des 'horloges biologiques'. Cependant il souligne le fait que ces études n'offrent aucun support aux prétentions de l'astrologie. Il conclut son article par un rappel des efforts qui ont été faits pour valider les prédictions astrologiques à l'aide de méthodes statistiques. Il insiste particulièrement sur les récents travaux de Gauquelin reliant le choix d'une profession à la position des planètes. Il démontre que Gauquelin a commis l'erreur de trouver une relation de cause à effet entre des phénomènes qui n'ont lieu simultanément que par accident, et aussi d'omettre des faits physiques connus d'une importance décisive."
"10.2307/1572688","Art Education in Trinidad","Constance E. Wagar","Leonardo",6,"2",1973-04-01,"pp. 131-136","10.2307/1572688","The MIT Press","fla","","The problems of education in the developing countries have been claiming an increasingly important place in educational research, especially during the last decade. These problems result from the factors of economic distress, political unrest and social change. In such conditions, concern has been felt for the fate of the arts and of art education in the Third World. It seems possible that practical and utilitarian subjects may crowd out aesthetic interests. The author's purpose was to explore the development of art education over the past century in one such emergent nation. Trinidad was selected because of the writer's association with its educational system over the past seventeen years as an art teacher and also as a secondary school principal in two different communities. A three-fold method of investigation was used: documentary evidence, interviews and visits to schools of various types. The findings from these visits are summarized and from these sources the writer has made certain conclusions and recommendations. Her impression is that the future of art education in Trinidad is a hopeful one. /// Les problèmes de l'éducation dans les pays en voie de développement ont pris une place de plus en plus importante dans la recherche en matière d'enseignement, particulièrement au cours de la dernière décade. Ces problèmes ont pour origine les difficultés économiques, l'instabilité politique et les changements sociaux. Dans de telles conditions, on s'est inquiété de l'avenir des arts et de l'éducation artistique dans le Tiers Monde. On peut se demander si des sujets ayant des préoccupations essentiellement pratiques et utilitaires n'auraient pas tendance à rejeter ce qui à trait à l'esthétique. L'intention de l'auteur était d'étudier le développement de l'éducation artistique au cours du siècle dernier dans un pays du Tiers Monde. Elle choisit Trinidad en raison de son expérience du système d'enseignement qui y est appliqué, d'une part en tant que professeur, d'autre part comme directrice d'établissement secondaire dans deux villes différentes. Elle utilisa une triple méthode d'investigation: par documentation, par interviews, et en visitant différentes écoles. Après avoir rapporté ces informations, l'auteur fait part des conclusions et réflexions auxquelles l'ont amenée ces divers éléments. Selon elle l'avenir de l'éducation artistique à Trinidad est plein de promesses."

His recent kinetic art installation 'Atavacron Series, I', involving the use of subliminal stimulation, is described and the results he obtained with it are discussed. He gives his reasons for concluding that the human eye is capable of picking up subliminal stimuli and that supraliminal images are more easily remembered when shown in conjunction with subliminal ones."

He feels that in the early 1960's, while in Japan, he was moved by egotism to produce collages of a type designed to revolt or shock viewers in order to attract attention to himself. He points out that a marked change occurred in his outlook on art when confronted with what he calls rational, materialist Occidental art. He also found that most Western artists completely fill the surface of a painting, as though they feared to give a feeling of empty space. He decided that a mystical approach was more congenial to him and turned to making paintings with serial images of hard-edge geometrical forms, which led him to make transformables made up of 4, 6 or 9 individual panels, each with a different but stylistically related image. He describes in detail the preparation of the panels, which are installed in a special frame."

This type of work is called 'electric light art' or 'light art'. She describes the way she was led to make these kinds of works, gives details of their construction and comments on their aesthetic qualities. She concludes with the hope that architects will arrange for collaboration between lighting engineers and sculptors of electric light art in order that lighting in buildings will be done in a more artistic manner."

That is, odor perception seems to result from a much more complex response than a simple one-to-one correspondence between the receptor sites and the molecular structure of the stimulant. Odor perception is considered by the author in analogy to a semantic information-conveying system. In animals, odor message interpretation is instinctive and fixed. At the human level some or all stimuli to the odor receptors have changing, contextual meaning. Their meaning can be modified by habit or by learning. The author postulates that sensory excitation due to pure chemical substances is similar to that due to words. They generally convey no meaning by themselves but only in context. This hypothesis suggests the adoption of techniques used in linguistics and cryptanalysis and the concept of olphemes, the odor perception equivalent of phonemes in language."

He finds that the philosophy of essence is of no use in helping artists or other creative individuals to find really valuable paths to follow among the vast number of theoretically possible paths. He finds that such guidance can be found only through a better understanding of relevant facts by resorting to controlled experiments. The difficulties of applying the principal method of science to experimental aesthetics are reviewed and some of the positive achievements of this new science are mentioned. He finds that it is the right and duty of those working in experimental aesthetics to take advantage of the knowledge accumulated by experimental psychologists in collaboration with physiologists, biologists and mathematicians. He ends with the hope that the science of art will become a part of the science of human behavior."

It is based on a number of courses in technology that he has taught to both art students and students in other nontechnical disciplines. The assumption on which the course is predicated is that the operation and application of much of modern technology (including, for example, lasers and holographic equipment) are no more difficult than the use of a motion picture camera or a film projector. The image of difficulty associated with modern technology has arisen from the necessity of specialized education for research and design engineers. Structurally, the course is built around a set of broad technological topics, including the scope and impact of technology, energy, materials, information handling and systems concepts. These topics are explored and illustrated in a variety of examples. Some of the illustrations include the man-machine interface, electricity and magnetism, computers, fiber optics, lasers, holography, simulation and control. The assignments and projects are chosen to encourage the students to apply various aspects of technology in the art of their interest. Throughout the course, emphasis is placed on their contact with technological resources and personnel both within the university and without."

Artists have ignored this significant visual discovery, as well as David Brewster's announcement in 1856 that it would be possible to view stereoscopically a whole surface covered with stereopaired designs and at the same time any single pair. These discoveries can be understood by artists when they learn the meaning of retinal disparity, coupled with the principles of Cyclopean sight. The author is convinced that stereoscopy will make a vital contribution to the visual arts. He calls upon artists to explore the unmapped territory of stereoscopic art. Such an art, in his view, will be as unprecedented in our time as was the development of the rules for linear perspective in the 15th century."

Bronowski","Leonardo",7,"2",1974-04-01,"pp. 117-121","10.2307/1572791","The MIT Press","fla","","The author points out that we live in a democracy of knowledge that began after 1450 with the spread of the printed book. The central principle that moves our society is the demand that the basis of action shall be verifiable knowledge. This is a public knowledge that is open to scrutiny of every member of society and has come to be called science. To test impersonally what is conjectured requires mechanical laboratory apparatus but mechanical watchdogs against bias have nothing to do with the content of knowledge. By the end of the 19th century a scientist had come to be regarded as a living extension of his own apparatus and it was expected that in time he would prove that man is a machine also. The author believes that this image has had the catastrophic consequence of provoking irrational crusades against all technology. In order to overcome this situation, intellectuals, artists above all, must shape a new imagery of science as understood in the 20th century--science cannot have the inhuman, mechanical kind of exactness ascribed to it in the 19th century and he gives reasons why this is so. The preoccupations of science have been moving from physics to biology, a historical subject. Man's evolution has been culture-driven and a central component in the ascent of man has been the manipulation of mental imagery and its expression in language and other symbolisms. Art is a powerful mover of the mind, for it helps to project thoughts forward, to form plans and to enlarge knowledge. For problems of conduct, general plans or grand strategies are devised that are called human values. Thus values are now seen as an integral part of the biological nature of man, of which the search for knowledge is a biological necessity."

Considerations of this type led the writer to similar conclusions as the one reached by the Spanish philosopher, Ortega Y Gasset, who spoke about the 'dehumanization' of modern art, entailing a new conception of the relationship of art to nature. The author points out that kinetic art produced by means of electric and electronic systems transcends the traditional definition of visual fine art in terms of form, since form need not be either static, or else, as it is in the kind of art to which Ortega Y Gasset refers, true-to-life. Furthermore, the prospects of man, art and technology will be brighter, the author believes, if new modes are found by which all the three can be brought to work together in harmony for the development of mankind's intellectual and spritual resources. This hope is likely to materialize when the tools of modern technology are used by artists to extend their creative capabilities."

A better knowledge of the inhabitants of the People's Republic of China is very much needed by the outside world. The authors, therefore, have analyzed examples of the classical Peking Opera, which were presented in China until about 1965, when, as a result of the Cultural Revolution, the emphasis and some of the techniques of the traditional drama were altered and some new subject matter was added. They point out, however, that in the modern revolutionary Peking Opera the essential form was changed remarkably little. The conclusions reached are the following ones. The Chinese seek to temporize conflicts and to search for nonviolent solutions. They seem to make an all-out effort to obtain reconciliation that does not cause either party to lose face. Life and death decisions are made slowly and only after time and trouble has been taken to look at many sides of an issue and then the decisions are person-centered rather than situation-centered. The possible implications of these conclusions on the relations of nations with the People's Republic of China are pointed out."

He stands firmly against the cold cerebral approach to art through technology and his outspoken criticism of the fads and fashions aspect of American art of the past decade is well known in the San Francisco Bay region of California. /// Le propos de l'auteur est de présenter sa peinture de 1943 à aujourd'hui. Au cours de cette période, il a appliqué sa conception du phénomène de l'énergie à la nature toute entière, du microcosme au macrocosme, en insistant particuliérement sur les notions déjà acquises par la physique atomique.

He considers the sample he chose to be representative of the population of the city of Montpellier, France, where the study was made. The purpose of the survey was to learn to what extent those interviewed were capable of recognizing and interpreting the subject matter. His belief was confirmed that communication between artists and the general public is greatly handicapped by its ignorance of artistic codes artists use (many of the codes having a long history) and its belief that only some subjects are suitable for art, which prevents the recognition of unexpected or unpalatable content. He gives the results he obtained from an examination of the individual opinions and comments offered by the viewers of projections of colored slides of the paintings. The author describes a subsequent series of drawings he made, taking into account the results of his survey. /// En 1970, à Montpellier (France), l'auteur effectua une étude sur 108 habitants, considérés par lui comme représentatifs de la population de cette ville. Il confronta cet échantillon à quatre de ses peintures représentant différents sujets figuratifs. Le but de cette expérience était de déterminer dans quelle mesure le public était capable de reconnaître et d'interpréter le sujet de ces œuvres. Ce que l'auteur pensait s'est trouvé confirmé. La communication entre les artistes et le public est considérablement gênée pour deux raisons: le public ignore les codes artistiques qui ont souvent une longue histoire, et il croit que seuls quelques sujets appartiennent au domaine artistique, ce qui lui interdit l'acceptation et la compréhension de certaines œuvres perçues comme imprévues ou désagréables. Il nous donne les conclusions qu'il a tirées de l'examen des différentes opinions individuelles, ainsi que des commentaires émis par les spectateurs lors d'une projection de ses peintures en diapositives couleurs. Il décrit ensuite une série de travaux ultérieurs à cette expérience, qu'il a réalisés en tenant compte des résultats obtenus."

At the same time, the domination of modern life by technology confronts the engineer with social, political and human problems for which the traditional forms of his education have scarcely prepared him. That new aspect of his training is being confronted on a world-wide basis. The present paper, based on a report given at a Unesco meeting on the humanistic and social-science education of engineers, exemplifies some recent developments in engineering education in the U.S.A. Various experimental programs, now under way, are designed to lead engineering students towards a greater consciousness of the social implications of their future professional work and to explore ways in which they can cope with this new range of problems confronting them. These educational projects are intended to make the humanities, arts and social sciences relevant to the professional education of engineers. /// La prise de conscience des dangers d'ordre écologique a conduit à une attitude beaucoup plus critique envers les sciences et la technologie. D'autre part, en raison de la mainmise de la technologie sur la vie moderne, l'ingénieur se trouve directement confronté à des problèmes sociaux, politiques et humains, problèmes auxquels le contenu traditionnel de ses études l'a peu préparé. Ce nouvel aspect de la formation des ingénieurs est l'objet de recherches dans le monde entier. Cet article, qui se fonde sur un rapport fait à l'Unesco lors d'un meeting sur l'éducation des ingénieurs en matière de sciences sociales et humaines, illustre quelques récents développements de la formation des ingénieurs aux Etats-Unis. Différents programmes expérimentaux en cours sont conçus d'une part pour amener les élèves ingénieurs à une plus grande conscience des implications sociales de leur futur métier, et d'autre part pour explorer les différentes voies qui leur permettront de faire face à ce nouveau type de problèmes.

Patricios","Leonardo",6,"4",1973-10-01,"pp. 311-318","10.2307/1572847","The MIT Press","fla","","The contributions that have been made by psychologists, anthropologists and others to the revision of our traditional concepts of space demand, in the author's view, a new approach to urban design, architecture and art. These contributions suggest that two basic categories of space must be distinguished: the physical and the mental. Mental space is shown not to have a one-to-one correspondence with the space that is part of the physical world, due to the mediation of various psychological and cultural factors. A concept of space may be said to originate in an observer's mind and is a structure that is imposed on the physical world. The author discusses how concepts of space have been found to differ on a cultural basis and he gives some examples of how they have influenced urban design, architecture and art in various cultures. To analyse this relationship further, mental space has been sub-divided into three major types: the biological, the symbolic and the mathematical. Specific examples are given of these as they have been embodied in the layout of towns, building design and painting. /// Les contributions que les psychologues, les anthropologues et d'autres ont apportées à la révision de nos conceptions traditionnelles de l'espace, appellent, selon l'auteur, une nouvelle approche de l'urbanisme, de l'architecture et de l'art. D'après ces nouveaux apports deux catégories fondamentales de l'espace doivent être distinguées: l'espace mental et l'espace physique. L'espace mental est décrit comme n'étant pas en relation univoque avec l'espace physique, partie du monde matériel qui nous entoure, mais comme différent de ce dernier, en raison de la médiation des différents facteurs psychologiques et culturels. On peut dire que le concept d'espace est originaire du cerveau de l'observateur et qu'il est une structure plaquée sur le monde physique. L'auteur décrit ensuite comment les concepts d'espace différent suivant les cultures et il donne quelques exemples de la façon dont ils ont influencé l'urbanisme, l'architecture et l'art dans différents environments culturels. Pour aller plus loin dans l'analyse de la relation espace mental--espace physique, l'espace mental a été subdivisé en trois grands groupes: le biologique, le symbolique et le mathématique. Des exemples sont donnés correspondant à chacun de ces groupes, ainsi que la façon dont ils ont été incorporés au tracé des villes, à l'habitat et aux formes picturales."

He concludes that though there is a limited sense in which 'black' aesthetics can be used as a concept, this sense is trivial and inconsequential. He finds no serious, supportable meaning of a theory of 'black' aesthetics as distinguished from general aesthetic theory, any more than there is one of a theory of, for example, 'white' organic chemistry or of 'Indian' trigonometry. /// L'auteur s'interroge sur la validité d'une théorie possible de l'esthétique 'noire', qui dans le domaine artistique est un aspect mineur du grand bouleversement social aux Etats-Unis impliquant les Afro-Américains. L'auteur en conclut que bien que l'on puisse utiliser le concept d'une esthétique 'noire' dans un sens limité, ce concept demeure superficiel et imprécis. Il pense que l'existence d'une théorie de l'esthétique 'noire' séparée de la théorie générale de l'esthétique n'a pas de signification sérieuse, de même qu'on ne pourrait soutenir l'hypothèse d'une théorie de la chimie organique 'blanche' ou de la trigonométrie 'indienne'."

He is sceptical of the attempts to produce computer art with commercially available display equipment and through play with randomness and by the deliberate introduction of errors in programs prepared for nonartistic ends. He favors the approach in which art objects are controlled by a computer with feedback from a viewer to the object or to the computer or both. He describes his kinetic object with flashing white lights in which the sequence of patterns is controlled by a special purpose computer for generating fields of abstract algebra or Galois fields. The second object he describes is more complex in that the frontal panel of flashing lights is made as a relief; colored light is used; the sequence of Galois field patterns can be changed in rhythm; and sound combinations corresponding to the patterns can be produced by the object. The mathematics of Galois fields generated by polynomial equations that was used for determining the sequence of patterns in the objects is described. One of the most interesting aspects of this work is the demonstration of the different visual appearance of the patterns resulting from the polynomials that had not been noted before by mathematicians who have studied Galois fields."
"10.2307/1572891","Conceptual Art: Transformation of Natural and of Cultural Environments","William Vazan, Paul Heyer","Leonardo",7,"3",1974-07-01,"pp. 201-205","10.2307/1572891","The MIT Press","fla","","The authors explore the possibility that the activity known as 'conceptual art', when evidenced in certain ways, may provide a link to the underlying structure of art. Projects of Vazan are analyzed with reference to this thesis. Art is looked at as an activity of signification (sign making) in which particular forms of conceptual art may represent 'signifiers' reduced to their most basic expression. The theoretical sustenance for this perspective is derived from the contemporary school known as structuralism. The premises of structuralism are briefly noted, with particular attention being paid to the observations of the French anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss. The sign function of the art point of view, propounded by Lévi-Strauss, is used for analyzing Vazan's artistic transformations of natural and cultural environments. The former are described in terms of how they might be transformed into culturally meaningful arrangements and the latter are described as attempts to make complex man-made environments more comprehensible."

His first attempts were limited to skeletal forms, for example balloon-supported parallelepipeds, either tethered to the ground or in free flight, but his later sculptures included interior elements as well that helped to reveal more sensitively the motion of air. More recently he has used balloon-supported smoke candles and road flares in free flight leaving trails that indicate air currents. The motion, light and sound in these nonpermanent sculptures thus make visually evident some of the characteristics of the atmosphere."
"10.2307/1572893","A Hypothesis of the Evolution of Art from Play","Ellen Dissanayake","Leonardo",7,"3",1974-07-01,"pp. 211-217","10.2307/1572893","The MIT Press","fla","","Observers of human behaviour have noticed similarities between art and play, e.g. both involve imagination, surprise, non-predictability and self-reward, and are considered biologically non-functional. Studies of these similarities led earlier philosophers and psychologists to construct hypotheses that attempted to explain art as arising from play during an individual's life span (that is to say, ontogenetically). Recent students of the subject agree, however, that these 'play theories' of art are inadequate to deal fully with the varieties of artistic activity. The author examines similarities between art (including both artistic creation and aesthetic experience) and play, and offers a hypothesis that concerns the origins of artistic activity using ethological concepts. The relationship between play and art is considered phylogenetically, i.e. art is said to have originated as a kind of play, gradually over millenia acquiring its own independence and individuality. In order for an evolutionary characteristic to be selected for, it must have adaptive value for the species and the author's reason for believing that art has this property is that it enhances both man's sociality and his self-assertion. She concludes with her conviction that art is a fundamental and necessary feature of human life."
"10.2307/1572894","Perspective Based on a New Optics","Vasco Ronchi","Leonardo",7,"3",1974-07-01,"pp. 219-225","10.2307/1572894","The MIT Press","fla","","The author discusses in a general way a new optics that is based not only on physics but also on physiological-psychological considerations. While an image of an object is formed on a retina in much the same way as an image is formed on a film in a camera, it is not the final product of human vision. The retinal image is processed by the brain and the final product is a mental image or 'ghost' that is fixed in space. For an object close to the eyes of a viewer, the 'ghost' tends to be located precisely at the position of the object and the viewer can be said to 'see the object'. But in the case of a more distant object, the brain fixes the 'ghost' at a position closer to the viewer than that occupied by the object viewed. The important consequences of this conception are discussed in the case of perspective, particularly as it applies to representational art work."
"10.2307/1572895","Intelligent Computers and Visual Artists","Michael Thompson","Leonardo",7,"3",1974-07-01,"pp. 227-234","10.2307/1572895","The MIT Press","fla","","In order to be of value to artists, computers must be perceptive and knowledgeable in visual matters. Being 'perceptive' means that they should be programmed to deal with phenomena that artists perceive and find interesting. Being 'knowledgeable' means here that the computer can use information stored in it to take appropriate courses of action. This paper deals with techniques that might be employed rather than discussing what aesthetic phenomena might be of interest. The techniques described are drawn from the so-called 'linguistic' approach to graphics, which is interpreted very broadly to include descriptive, hierarchical, structural, grammatical, and proceedural methods. In short, nonnumerical rather than numerical methods based on statistical criteria, information theory, evaluation of mathematical functions or optimization. The paper refers to the generation of shapes using grammars, analysis using grammars, picture description languages, explicit representation of semantic information using semantic nets and implicit representation using procedures. Human subjective observation of computer behavior is suggested as a sufficient guide to the valid application of these techniques."

A number of different types of illusions are possible. Two types that he illustrates are the Benussi and Musatti effects. Two others that he describes he terms topological transformations and topological deformations (the latter is thought by the author to be an illusion not previously known)."

He then discusses the problems of applying light for artistic purposes from the point of view, primarily, of his own experiences with kinetic painting systems. These include the direct transmission of light to the eye or onto a translucent screen (Lumidyne system), the production of reflected light images on a translucent screen (Reflectodyne system) and the transmission of light through polarizing materials (Polaridyne system). Technical details of the systems are given and the reactions of viewers of these kinds of art objects are briefly presented. The author states that, although he is a reluctant prophet, he would not be surprised if a wide acceptance of kinetic art with electric light must await the passage of several more decades."

The phenomenon of contrast, so well exemplified by works of Claude Monet and Josef Albers, is cited as evidence of nonconstancy. Experimentally observed response of individual retinal cells to very small light beams is used to support the principle of retinal antagonistic organization as applied in color vision and is extended to spatial hue and lightness contrast. The finding that individual retinal cells have 'receptive fields' that differ in size is used to account for the opposite phenomenon of assimilation. The authors direct attention to contemporary and older paintings and graphic works that possess the particularly interesting effect obtained when assimilation is present."

He believes that art will become a more vital force in the lives of more people than it is now, if systems methodology used in advanced technology is applied to the analyses of the working methods of artists, of the objects that they make and of the reactions of viewers to their objects. After discussing his views on free will and creativity, he describes simplified systems models of these processes in terms of information processing by the human brain. He then outlines his approach to making paintings in the light of the system models that he presents and comments on several of his works to guide viewers to an understanding of their intended content."
"10.2307/1573006","A Proposed Notation for Visual Fine Art","John G. Harries","Leonardo",8,"4",1975-10-01,"pp. 295-300","10.2307/1573006","The MIT Press","fla","","A notation system for the visual fine arts should provide the means for indicating certain visual aspects of a work as an aid to artists in formulating concepts and executing them. It also should permit the recording and transmission of these aspects to others in a simple manner. A notation for movements of the body in dancing, athletics, etc., the Eshkol-Wachman Movement Notation, has suggested to the author the employment of an analogous method in visual art. The basic assumption made is that two-dimensional shapes and three-dimensional forms can be generated by the motion of lines or chains of lines. Thus complex shapes can be described in the notation by specifying the synchronization of motions, the lengths of lines, the omission of lines etc. The rigour of the notation makes it suitable for computer use but the author stresses the notation's value as an aid to artists who deal manually with complex shapes in paintings or sculpture."

Then he points to the differences and similarities of the hypotheses of Hobbes, of the psychologist J. J. Gibson and of the physicist V. Ronchi. Gibson's hypothesis resembles that of Hobbes in important ways. Yet the author prefers the one by Ronchi, which is based on facts of experience rather than an idealistic postulate and is suitable for explaining pathological visual phenomena."
"10.2307/1573008","Perspective Using Curved Projection Rays and Its Computer Application","Horacio C.

Instead of being confined by the rules of linear perspective, which governs retinal and photographic images, he employs a more general mathematical model that provides a family of perspectives. Each member of the family is designated individually by a numerical value (between 0 and 1) for its index i. The lowest value, i = 0, leads to the linear equation that applies to linear perspective; application of the highest value, i = 1, results in axonometric projection. Sometimes linear perspective leads to a drawing or to a photographic image that seems grossly distorted in comparison with what one perceives in looking at an object. The author's method, employed with fractional values for i and with the same viewpoint, may be used to produce more acceptable drawings."

The author begins with a description of the Cromalin color-proofing system. He then discusses the application of Cromalin film to the making of fine art prints, pointing out some of the innovations that have been made. The technique can be applied to the making of editions. Unlike most photographic processes, work with Cromalin film is done under normal room illumination. Consideration of the acrylic polymer, the high quality pigments and the base paper suggests that a Cromalin print may possess a permanence essentially equivalent to that which can be expected for paintings made with present-day acrylic paints."

He distinguishes four phases in his work during the decade 1963 to 1973. The first phase is represented by works that result from tearing, crushing or otherwise violently treating materials and constructing objects from them. In this phase he saw himself in conflict with the materials. In the second phase he combined contrasting materials together, to give the impression that the materials are in conflict with each other. His third phase involves transformables are intended to be acted upon by viewers, that is, they can be taken to be in conflict with them. Finally, in the fourth phase, he prepared works in which flexible materials assumed shapes under various influences, such as gravity, shrinkage and swelling, to give a viewer the feeling that they were attempting to escape from their constraints."

"10.2307/1573060","Streamlining and American Industrial Design","Donald J. Bush","Leonardo",7,"4",1974-10-01,"pp. 309-317","10.2307/1573060","The MIT Press","fla","","Motion has become both a subject and a tool for the modern artist. Those who choose to embody in their work the quality of smooth and continuous (rather than staccato and disrupted) motion can find ample inspiration in nature. Animals that swim or fly, adapted to their fluid environments, inspired the smooth, organic forms in Constantin Brancusi's sculpture as well as in the biomorphic art of other artists. These streamlined forms were also observed by ships' architects and the pioneers of the science of flight, who applied them to the technology of transport. The modern passenger plane, a clear and popular symbol of advanced technology, became fully streamlined in the early 1930's. Its forms were anticipated by American industrial designers, who began to apply them to terrestrial vehicles in the hope of improving their efficiency and appearance. Eventually, architecture, furniture and other products were 'streamlined', for the streamlined form symbolized efficiency and a new machine aesthetic, one of dynamic functionalism. Norman Bel Geddes, Raymond Loewy, Henry Dreyfuss and other designers promoted an optimistic vision of the future, free of the economic chaos and social turbulence of the economic depression of the 1930's. By merging forms with flowing contours and rounded edges and concealing visually complex mechanisms in simple shells, the new designers created an awareness of the beauty of uncluttered sculptural forms in useful products. The receptivity to streamlined forms was conditioned by aircraft and more generally by a desire for harmonious existence. The accelerated pace and complexity of life in advanced technology countries makes enormous psychic demands. Streamlining, which has come to mean any method of improving efficiency and reducing waste, is manifest not only in industrial design but in, for example, literature and cinema, where it implies continuums of experience free of distractions and disruptions."
"10.2307/1573061","Thematic Structure of Strindberg's 'A Dream Play'","Barbara Lipman-Wulf","Leonardo",7,"4",1974-10-01,"pp. 319-323","10.2307/1573061","The MIT Press","fla","","The author discusses with the help of diagrams the thematic structure of August Strindberg's drama ""A Dream Play,"" in which she finds two dominant themes. One, typified by consecutive changes of place, is more easily noted through the wanderings of the heroine. The other theme, given by consecutive change at a place is, although more significant in the play, less obvious. The heroine, a deity, descends upon the Earth, pursues an earthly existence at various places and then ascends to Heaven. The author cites Strindberg's use of symbolism and finds that he achieves a well-balanced structure by designing the consecutive changes as substantially equal entities. The author concludes with a discussion, based on the Prologue of the play, of the use of language to reveal the heroine's mood in confronting different situations on the Earth. By the appropriate choice of words her spiritual strength is shown to decline in the first part of the play and mount in the second part counter to the rise and fall of her physical being."

For interference colours to be perceived, it is necessary for the surface to have a laminar structure in which the thickness of successive layers is of the same order of magnitude as the wavelength of light. He then analyses the production of interference colours, both in simple thin films and in multilayers. Finally, the identification of iridescent colours as a special form of interference colours is considered and their occurrence in nature is described, with examples from birds, beetles, fishes and butterflies."

The contents of several of his pictures are discussed. He points out the distinction that he recognizes between 'space age' art and science fiction art--primarily that in the former fewer liberties are taken with knowledge available on a subject depicted. Since about 1970 he also has made paintings of a science fiction type. In the remaining parts of the article he reviews briefly the historical precedents for science fiction art based on his years of being a science fiction (SF) devotee and gives his estimate of the quality of some of this art at present in Britain, the U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R."

The pictures are based on selected computer drawings that are made by the deformation of initial designs. An initial design is a composition made up of a pattern of repeated units. Deformations are accomplished by applying displacement vectors, simulating deforming forces, at chosen locations in the design such that the points defining each of the units are displaced. Points closest to the tail of a vector are displaced most, in accordance with an assumed mathematical rule. The authors discuss their motivation for this work along with the computer program that they use. Four serigraphs and a computer drawing made on the basis of the computer output from three rather different series are discussed. Several novel ideas for investigation in the future are indicated."

In the 19th century, scientists like M. E. Chevreul, James Clerk Maxwell, Hermann von Helmholtz and Ogden N. Rood fostered new principles drawn from physiological optics. In the 20th century, came Op art that took cues from psychology, but which dealt mostly with optical phenomena, that is, with ways in which the retina and lens of the eye handled color stimuli. This article deals with color effects that carry on through the eye itself, up the optic nerve and into the brain, the seat of perception. The brain may well interpret what the eye sees in singular ways. Of particular significance is awareness of the fact, as pointed out by David Katz, that in human vision there is an independent sense of illumination. Exploitation of this sense gives promise of new modes of color expression for the future."

In this article he develops his proposal further and shows that shapes act as syntactic elements in the languages of painting styles. He meets Nelson Goodman's objections to his proposal by showing that shapes meet the criterion of syntactic discreteness proposed by the latter to separate linguistic from other symbolic systems. His approach is to specify style as the domain of a language of painting, to show that style is syntactical and to argue that shapes are the primitive syntactic elements of style. His essay relates current research on the development of syntax for picture-reading machines to the question of syntax for paintings."

Simplified versions of the techniques for use by artists are briefly described. They hope their article will stimulate more artists to consider patterns in fluid flows as sources for the content of their works."
"10.2307/1573182","Paintings Based on Relative Pitch in Music","Barbara Hero","Leonardo",8,"1",1975-01-01,"pp. 13-19","10.2307/1573182","The MIT Press","fla","","The author's approach to painting changed direction in 1961 when she began formal studies of music. She adopted relative pitch as a measure for quantitatively differentiating musical tones represented in her paintings. Specifically, the pitch of a tone was designated in terms of the ratio of its frequency to that of middle C on a piano. She chose a scale with the aid of the Lambdoma diagram or Pythagorean table. The values of the resulting relative pitches and their reciprocals were appropriate for the representation of tones by radii or by areas in her paintings. In addition, for each musical tone she has assigned a specific color, a designation that she generally keeps constant. All the paintings of this series are of a geometrical character. She calls attention to two interesting results that have a relationship to musical tones in a circle of fifths. For example, her assigned colors in a circle of fifths appear as a sequence of complementary color pairs. The planets assigned by G. Arnoux to musical tones, when they are arranged in the order of ascending fifths, occur in a sequence corresponding to the positions of the planets from the Sun."

Adams","Leonardo",8,"1",1975-01-01,"pp. 21-25","10.2307/1573183","The MIT Press","fla","","Curves are either flattened or sharpened when they are foreshortened in perspective. The two kinds of foreshortening seem to be perceived differently. The author argues that in some respects we see the world flatter than it is, and that, for example, Cézanne's and Mondrian's figurative paintings reflect this fact."

This method is applicable not only to simple geometric shapes and symbols but also to complex patterns and to social patterns and to patterns in aesthetic and linguistic form. This breadth of approach is one of the major goals towards which the Gestalt psychologists have pointed. He presents a series of matrices to illustrate both the development and the logic of this new approach. An application to culture-fair intelligence is noted, as well as a new and important distinction between monocular (form) and binocular (brightness) matching processes. Extensions of matrices to Op art and to a model of ethics are illustrated."

In 1968 she began to use a computer to assist her. The computer displays (on a CRT screen) images in which shapes and/or their arrangement are altered successively. When she sees a pleasing example that she may wish to execute as a drawing or a painting, she instructs the computer to record it on a plotter. She has studied a number of such series in which alterations occur successively in small steps to determine which alteration is responsible for the appearance of a picture that she judges to be aesthetically superior to those that preceded it. She includes an example of of her judgment of the aesthetic quality of pictures chosen from a particular series."

Not only can the modules be arranged in numerous rectangular compositions but they also can be hung separately or be combined to form other shapes. Furthermore, modules from one matrix are intended to be combined with those from others. Back lighting is mentioned: this is especially effective for coarsely woven tapestries. He proposes the use of modules of different sizes, not only in 2-dimensional arrangements but also in structures around and through which viewers may walk. He discusses briefly the technique of weaving that he uses and his approach in the design of his compositions. He describes his earlier outdoor 3-dimensional art in a playground at Istres, France, where the public is invited to participate in arranging the parts of the work. This project was the stimulus leading to his work on transformable tapestries."

In contrast to traditional modes of static light reflection, the images in the Lumia genre of kinetic art are back-projected onto a translucent screen, change color and may be in motion. The psychophysics underlying the medium and the aesthetics appropriate to it have been studied but little. The author first reviews the physical bases and technological advances that have made Lumia kinetic art possible. Secondly, he initiates a consideration of the aesthetics of color as perceived on a screen of Lumia by examining, in a series of empirical investigations, the hedonics of such color. These results are then analyzed in the context of an aesthetical doctrine known as 'aesthetics from below'."

The main result of the work is the development of a formalism, an aesthetic system, for the algorithmic specification of aesthetic viewpoints. An aesthetic viewpoint is taken to consist of a collection of interpretative conventions and evaluative criteria for art. Interpretative conventions determine how an object can be understood as a work of art; evaluative criteria determine the judged quality of such an object when it is understood in this way. Viewpoints vary for different people, different cultures and different art forms. These systems allow for the specification of different viewpoints in terms of a uniformly structured system of algorithms. An example of an aesthetic system for nonfigurative, rectilinear pictures is given. This system is applied to six pictures shown in the paper. The computer implementation of the system is described briefly."

The transition involved a stark simplification of subject matter. The nonfigurative works contain but few lines on a plain, generally neutrally colored background. Sometimes simple shapes, e.g. wood discs, are glued to the canvas. The lines are of two kinds: smooth lines as drawn with the aid of a ruler, compass etc. and what he calls 'free' lines, drawn in an obviously less steady manner. In his most recent works, he is preoccupied with very simple compositions of vertical and horizontal lines. He discusses his work in relation to his thoughts on art and, in particular, to a style that he calls Essentialism."

He mentions the poetic works of the French symbolists and the Italian futurists and the paintings and drawings of Odilon Redon, of the cubists and the futurists and of the pioneers of non-figurative or abstract art in which the verbal and visual media were synthesized. The roles of labels and identity clues and the applications of aspects of calligraphy to bring about a fruitful interplay between the two media are also described."

He presents his method of making paintings in the light of what artists have done in the past, including his assessment of the importance of the relationships of the smallest basic unit (i.e. the daub of paint or brush-stroke) to the whole surface of a picture and the roles of texture and of colour hue and tone both in a painting's support and in the materials used for executing a picture. Maintaining that there is no essential difference between non-figurative or abstract and figurative art, he points out that the 'object' of a picture, if represented with workmanlike integrity, often implies a meaning or significance beyond the conscious intention of the artist, whereas the deliberate attempt to make a painting on a specific 'subject' involves problems outside the province of picture-making that are often detrimental to the final result. Examples of his own paintings serve to illustrate the ideas that he advances on the basis of his practical experience."

Derȩgowski","Leonardo",9,"1",1976-01-01,"pp. 19-23","10.2307/1573294","The MIT Press","fla","","The author examines scanty evidence available at the present about perceptions of a person seeing a picture for the first time. He suggests that the phenomenon can probably be described satisfactorily in terms of hypothesis testing and that the responses evoked in populations living in relatively pictureless environments by simple pictures are probably of the same kind as those evoked in the more pictorially sophisticated groups by complex pictures."
"10.2307/1573295","A Psychological Model for Aesthetic Experience","Peter F. Smith","Leonardo",9,"1",1976-01-01,"pp. 25-31","10.2307/1573295","The MIT Press","fla","","Since World War II three hypothetical models of the way the human brain may work have been proposed on the basis of research by physiologists and psychologists, which the author calls (1) phylogenetic-evolutionary, (2) attitudinal and (3) functional-hierarchical. These models are briefly reviewed. Comments on the implications of these models for vision are made in terms of four proposed attitudes to the way the brain may process information. The first two concern the perceptual modes of the left and right hemispheres of the neocortex; the third the synthesis of neocortical and limbic system activity and the fourth the reaction of the limbic system to stimuli according to built-in criteria. The results of these considerations are applied to aesthetic experience, in particular to an analysis of urban aesthetics of a section of the town of Dartmouth, Devonshire, England. The author concludes that through experience of aesthetic satisfaction a way may be available to bring about a balanced interaction between cortical opposites. If experience brings about structural changes in the brain, as some believe, then those who shape the urban environment have a fearful responsibility as regards the aesthetic responses that they provoke."

Some pieces in the series contain one or more umbrellas or umbrella parts, others refer to the idea of an umbrella; some are kinetic pieces, some are static. He tells about his thoughts as this work progressed and gives his interpretations of several objects in the series, stressing their functionally nonsensical character."

He describes a model for the method that he has found very useful. He points out the merits and deficiencies of his model and compares it with one proposed by H. C. Reggini. He describes a device that he has made that aids him in generating drawings representing views in perspective corresponding approximately to the perspective represented by his model. He gives the procedure that he follows for making drawings in positive and negative perspective and presents several examples of constructions based on drawings generated in these ways."

Ward","Leonardo",9,"4",1976-10-01,"pp. 279-288","10.2307/1573353","The MIT Press","fla","","The author examines the validity of various proposals for modifying pictorial perspective to make it correspond more closely with the world as it is perceived. He then considers pictures that deviate from accurate perspective construction and discusses why the deviations occurred. The consequences of viewing perspective pictures from a position other than the projection point are analyzed. The evidence for the intelligibility of pictures, including those in perspective, to naive viewers is discussed. He concludes that, although a perspective picture normally seen does not duplicate the scene that it depicts (viewers are aware that they are looking at a flat surface as well as a depicted space), its perception does not require any learning other than learning to discriminate between information for flatness, which is supplied by surface relationships and information for depth in the form of invariant relationships, which is provided by the artist."

He finds that he has accomplished this by means of his large-scale events that are based on the theme of the sundial. He hopes that the public, attracted by the functional character of the sundial, will obtain aesthetic satisfaction from the artistic aspects of the events and also see the surrounding environments in a new way. He describes a number of sundial events that he has produced or proposed, some of which make use of existing city buildings and monuments as gnomons. He has also made sundial sculptures and proposed a design for a sundial fountain."

The geometry of polyhedra defines the organization of structural elements in space, either at the macro or at the micro level, in loose or in dense space-packing arrangements. He discusses the geometrical relationships between polyhedra, space-packing configurations, examples in nature and the rationale of his polyhedral sculpture. In addition to illustrations of his sculpture, he shows examples of his painting and architectural designs."

She relates her experiences in Greece and North Africa leading to this change. Her drawings reflect her interest in perspective and architecture. Her work is based on a linear module combined into figures or large-scale compositions of a paradoxical nature. Her discussion is supported by reproductions of a selection of her drawings."

He begins by claiming that the moral discussion of art actually centres around two distinct but related axes. The first involves the moral judgment of the art object itself and raises empirical and philosophical questions. The second, less often pondered but no less puzzling, concerns moral issues that center around the artist as an individual. The author therefore proceeds to identify three distinguishable types of moral demand that may be placed on artists: first, demands that are held to apply to everyone as a moral being and, therefore, apply equally to artists; second, demands that apply particularly but not exclusively to artists as socal participants, with certain significant controls and influence; and third, those that apply uniquely to artists, since these demands derive from the peculiar character of the tasks and powers of artists. The principal intent of this paper is to pursue and illuminate these types of moral demand, particularly the third, and to examine their interrelationships."
"10.2307/1573423","A Cybernetic Approach to Aesthetics","Herbert W. Franke","Leonardo",10,"3",1977-07-01,"pp. 203-206","10.2307/1573423","The MIT Press","fla","","The author considers, in particular, the information contained in pictures and the way in which artists produce them and viewers respond to them from the point of view of cybernetics. He points out (1) that the maximum rate at which the human brain can consciously receive discrete items or bits of information from the senses is about 16 bits/sec and (2) that, since the short-term memory can retain information for only about 10 sec (the period can be extended by mental concentration, but during such concentration the information input is stopped), the brain can consciously process no more than 160 bits at a time. These limitations are then used to examine the structure of pictures and of the process of viewing them. The characteristics of pictures, their information as messages and the way they stimulate emotional reactions in viewers are briefly discussed. The strategy and tactics used by artists to capture and hold the interest of viewers of a picture are outlined. While the author states that it is not easy to measure the amount of information in an artwork and to account for subjective reactions to it, he believes that cybernetic aesthetics will bring an end to the era of sophistry in the discussion of art, because it provides a rational way for understanding the human phenomenon of art and of aesthetic perception."

The Council gave commissions to many little publicized artists and brought a considerable amount of art into the environment of people who seldom went to museums. The author deplores the fact that its successor in 1966, the Greater London Council, has decided upon a budget that amounts to one-quarter of the amount allocated in 1957 and that it is earmarked for occasional acquisitions of works by well-publicized artists."

The first is concerned with 3-dimensional reliefs derived from 2-dimensional photomicrographs of metals and other materials. The second is concerned with reliefs that have modular characteristics. These have connections with the ordering found in some structures in nature revealed by science and a quality of 'all-overness', which is one of the more frequently recognized characteristics of such structures. This latter also underlies some of the author's pen and ink drawings, even though they are essentially representational works of objects such as buildings and trees."

The design system has been made possible by taking account of the close parallels between logic (Boolean algebra), electronic circuitry and overlap in a Venn diagram. Examples of pictures generated by the system are shown. Each picture can be considered as a unified whole of pictorial relationships and also (this is more important) as just one of the possible compositions in the broad spectrum of order relationships allowed by the design system. The author points out that the object of this kind of work is not how to produce single artistically unique pictures but rather to develop a process for the generation of pictures to help make evident some other changes in relationships that are indicative of the interdependence of various aspects (cultural, technological, economic, social, political, etc.) of the real world. Also, this kind of work can be considered as a contribution to efforts to bring about interdisciplinary cooperation, which is felt to be an important cultural objective today."
"10.2307/1573499","A Socialist Critique of Art History in the U.S.A.","Edmund Burke Feldman","Leonardo",11,"1",1978-01-01,"pp. 23-28","10.2307/1573499","The MIT Press","fla","","The socialist critique of art history derives from the fact that the making, distribution and appreciation of art in Western societies has become an extension of capitalist economics and that therefore the conditions applying to capitalist modes of production and consumption apply also in the realm of aesthetics. The nature of this new relationship between artists, middlemen and the general public tends to be obscured or ignored by traditional art scholarship that analyzes styles and schools of art mainly in terms of pre-capitalist economics. The history of art as a discipline does not seem capable of dealing with new artistic technologies and new relationships between artists, art consumers and the modern impressarios of mass culture who have no obvious counterparts in European history during the main periods into which art history has been divided. As a result, art historical writing and teaching fail to provide the public with adequate conceptual tools to deal with the present significance of art. By treating the history of contemporary art much as it treats medieval or Renaissance art, historians continue to emphasize the privileged character of art objects and their status as a precious commodity in a market of fluctuating pecuniary values. Unfortunately, this approach does not come to grips with the character of inexpensively reproduced imagery as it affects the behavior of members of the general public. Furthermore, in their analysis of traditional works of art as models of 'quality', art historians serve the interests of collectors and investors more than the interests of students and of the general public who need to understand the visual sources of their social and spiritual situation."
"10.2307/1573500","Left and Right in Science and Art","Charles G. Gross, Marc H. Bornstein","Leonardo",11,"1",1978-01-01,"pp. 29-38","10.2307/1573500","The MIT Press","fla","","An asymmetric object can exist in two left-right mirror-image forms, enantiomorphs, a phenomenon which has fascinated philosophers, cosmologists and artists. Psychologists and neurophysiologists have been particularly puzzled by the extreme difficulty children and other animals have in learning to distinguish left-right mirror images. The authors propose an explanation of why mirror images are so confusing. In the natural world almost all mirror images are actually two aspects of the same object, for example, the two sides of a face or a silhouette viewed from the front and back. Therefore a perceptual mechanism that treats mirror images as equivalent would be adaptive. The perceptual equivalence of mirror images only becomes maladaptive or confusing under very special conditions. One of these is learning an orthography containing mirror images such as b and d. Difficulty in learning to read, may, in part, be due to difficulty in overcoming the normal tendency to treat mirror images as the same stimulus. In the final portion of the paper the authors consider the effects of mirror-reversing a painting and, more generally, left and right in pictorial space. They suggest that some pictorial anisotropies, such as profile orientation, reflect the influence of lateralized brain functions, whereas others, such as the tendency to look at a picture from left to right, are cultural conventions."

Galeyev","Leonardo",9,"3",1976-07-01,"pp. 177-182","10.2307/1573549","The MIT Press","fla","","The author describes the work of the Group 'Prometei' (SKB) at Kazan, U.S.S.R. on combining kinetic electric light art with music since the founding of the Group in 1962. Public performances have been given in which the motion and the colour of projected light images were manually controlled in an attempt to correlate them with either the individual qualities or the themes or with both of these aspects of music. The Group believes that the manual control of kinetic images to obtain such correlations offers more hope for this type of artistic medium than audio-kinetic art using electronic and electro-mechanical devices to control the correlations automatically. Applications of the methods that they have devised in this domain for a proposed music-kinetic art concert hall and for outdoor spectacles of the Son et Lumière type are mentioned as well as future projects. The Group organizes periodic All-Soviet Union Conferences on 'Light and Music', the third having been held from 27 June to 4 July 1975 at Kazan."
"10.2307/1573550","The Collotype Printing Process: A Proposal for Its Revival","Kent Kirby","Leonardo",9,"3",1976-07-01,"pp. 183-186","10.2307/1573550","The MIT Press","fla","","The author discusses the collotype printing process that was developed during the 19th century primarily for the reproduction of fine photographs where high fidelity is important. The process is described in considerable detail. Although collotype is now seldom used, the author believes that its revival in the fine arts should be attempted in view of the wider interest in prints of high quality. An extensive bibliography of texts dealing with the process is provided."

He is interested in mosaics of the kind in which one proceeds freely from a rough preliminary drawing or cartoon, a technique called 'Byzantine painting' by André Grabar. He describes aspects of the technique that will be useful to those who desire to try this form of pictorial art."
"10.2307/1573552","Experiments on the Interaction of Color and Form","Lois Swirnoff","Leonardo",9,"3",1976-07-01,"pp. 191-195","10.2307/1573552","The MIT Press","fla","","The author believes that color can be combined with form in design to serve as an attribute of an object's perceived 3-dimensionality. This idea was pursued and supported by experiments performed by her with her students of design and architecture with a 3-dimensional object constructed of seven square panels that were assembled to resemble three cubes joined together in a particular arrangement. The panels were colored in different ways to determine how colors can (1) enhance the perception of convex cubes, (2) cause cubes to produce alternating illusions of concavity and convexity and (3) cause one of the cubes to appear convex and another to appear flattened. She believes that advantage can be taken of the color attribute of form in environmental design. A visual principle that has emerged from these studies is that ambiguity in the monocular perception of 3-dimensionality may occur when a boundary between two adjacent colors appears more pronounced than a physical boundary, possibly a significant aspect of camouflage."
"10.2307/1573553","Still-Life Paintings in a Consumer Society","R. G. Saisselin","Leonardo",9,"3",1976-07-01,"pp. 197-203","10.2307/1573553","The MIT Press","fla","","The author analyzes the role and character of still-life painting as exemplified by the 'vanity' pictures of the 17th century, the autonomous still lifes of the 18th century, the still lifes nonillustrative of discourse of the 19th century and the Pop art still lifes dictated by the imperatives of 20th-century consumer societies. His main attention is given to an interpretation of the impact on the art of a society in which commercial considerations override those of aesthetics. He finds that mass production and advertising deny not only art in the old sense, but also personal possession, originality and taste, since these are affected and effected by market research. Pop art still life in such a world can thus become an ironic comment upon the difficulties of individual choice and vision."
"10.2307/1573554","The Sociology of Time: Histories and Historians in the Cultures of the West and of China","Peter Young","Leonardo",9,"3",1976-07-01,"pp. 205-208","10.2307/1573554","The MIT Press","fla","","The author points out that in Western culture a linear conception of time and of causality is taken for granted. This view may have to be reassessed in the future, in certain areas of physics, at least. The traditional Chinese conception of time was that events occurred in time in a cyclical manner, perhaps because of the strong agricultural aspect of the society. The author discusses how these conceptions of time arose, how they influence the interpretation of events by historians and how they are used to maintain the ideological status quo of a society."

His aim was to develop a vehicle for such paint having a surface that has a hardness comparable to that of dry oil paint, yet is not brittle. To obtain helpful ideas he surveyed ancient encaustic procedures and recipes. Then he prepared several series of beeswax-resin mixtures that he tested for hardness, flexibility and workability in paints. He recommends several as being of a superior type. The author hopes that his investigation will stimulate others to experiment with encaustic vehicles."

The series reflects the influence of Hindu religion and philosophy on his world outlook. He kept notes regularly of his thoughts as he made the pictures. His choice of colours and the application of repetition of elements in a composition are discussed. Also, relationships arising from deciding on aspects of composition in a spontaneous manner and from self-imposed restrictions consisting of the choice of a single subject and the use of a specific technique with the same type of materials for the series are considered."

Apter","Leonardo",10,"1",1977-01-01,"pp. 17-21","10.2307/1573621","The MIT Press","fla","","The basic arguments of this paper are that art is not intrinsically mysterious and that there is no reason why art should not serve various functions for computers as well as for human beings. Asking what such functions might be for computers leads to an examination of the functions of art for humans from a new perspective. The author suggests that artworks are like computer programs and observers of artworks must develop compilers in their brains to decode them (music, however, may be said to be in machine code in certain of its aspects, that is, already decoded). One function of art is then to provide observers with practice in constructing de-coding compilers. Other functions of art are also suggested. It is further argued that more attention should be paid to semantic features of representational visual art and that from this point of view such an artwork can be regarded as a program that incorporates a model. Compiling here involves two processes: (1) reconstructing reality from a model and (2) inferring an underlying general theoretical construct that it exemplifies."
"10.2307/1573622","What Is a Christian Painting?","F. David Martin","Leonardo",10,"1",1977-01-01,"pp. 23-29","10.2307/1573622","The MIT Press","fla","","The author proposes a distinction between subject matter, form (the style of depiction), and content in a painting. The subject matter is what the painting 'is about', but it is not directly perceivable when it has been transformed by the form. The content is the artist's interpretation of subject matter as revealed by the form. Whereas decorative pictures are designed to please, fine art is also designed to inform. To reveal what is considered the religious a painter is expected to depict the sacred as awesome. In turn, the awe-fullness of what a religion considers sacred should generate the conviction in viewers that their relation to the sacred is of ultimate concern. Furthermore, a painting that belongs to a religious tradition will include in its subject matter a third basic component: institutionalized conventional symbols. These have the function of what the author calls 'conceptual meditation', that is, to visually articulate a religion's understanding of its concern for the sacred. In our time, the response of Christians to conventional symbols of their religion has been declining. These symbols will die, be modified or be replaced. The adequacy of his analysis is tested by the author with reference to a series of paintings."

Buchanan's work, progressing from standing metal sculpture to metal wall reliefs, is described. He exploits the contrasting surface texture and lustre of steel, chrome-plated steel and aluminum. Often he modifies surfaces by grinding and polishing to achieve painterly qualities. These effects are enhanced by the use of paint and by shading with the use of soot from an acetylene flame. In fact, his reliefs occupy an intermediate category between sculpture and painting. Now he proposes to make reliefs in the horizontal plane, 'table reliefs'."

The properties of laser radiation are briefly described. This is followed by a report on artistic applications he has made of lasers for the production of still and kinetic images for use, in particular, in the theater and cinema. The work was carried out under sponsorship of the Scientific Film Association of the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences. The author developed a laser apparatus for producing kinetic images whose motion can be correlated with rhythm and intensity variations in music. Technical details of the apparatus are provided. In cooperation with Miroslav Nýdl, he used the apparatus in several theater and cinema productions, which are described."

Teachers are highly resistant to the introduction of new developments in contemporary art in advanced technology countries. He reports that students, in general, also are conservative in their attitudes to nontraditional art. Furthermore, during the past few years funds for hiring of teachers and purchase of art materials have been declining. He describes the program he has initiated and directed at the Newton Creative Arts Center to develop projects intended to lead to a modernization of school art courses. He draws some tentative conclusions on the results obtained by the program."

Adams","Leonardo",10,"2",1977-04-01,"pp. 107-112","10.2307/1573686","The MIT Press","fla","","The problem of pictorial representation is partly a philosophical, partly an empirical one. Specifically, how can X represent Y; how can X be perceived as something other than what it is? Several traditional pseudo-answers to this question are reviewed, as well as recent more sophisticated ones. An explanation in terms of perceptual invariants is supplemented with a phenomenological description of the attentional act required in both real-world and pictorial perception. It is proposed that rather than similar visual features of X and Y, it is parts of identical attentional acts during the perception of the features that constitute their relationship and that the traditional concept of representation in visual art is misleading. This idea is illustrated by considering an artist's tasks as conceptualization and recording of perceptual experience."

With its use designs can be specified and displayed on the screen of a computer terminal; these can be modified and redisplayed until results deemed satisfactory are obtained.

The authors describe the method in general terms for those with no computer experience and discuss its general applicability."
"10.2307/1573688","The Limits of Intuition","D. N. Perkins","Leonardo",10,"2",1977-04-01,"pp. 119-125","10.2307/1573688","The MIT Press","fla","","Popular lore suggests that intuitive value judgments guide artists in their work and that judgments based on reasons could not provide the sensitive insight needed. Coupled with this are other informal beliefs about intuition. This paper assesses these beliefs. Intuition is analyzed as cognition without reasons and argued to be closely related to perception. While some might think that intuition represents a rare or special mode of cognition, much of perceiving amounts to intuiting. Though intuition often serves where reasons offer little help, just the opposite frequently occurs. Intuition is not endowed with special certainty. Intuition does bear a special kind of relevance, but not a special degree of relevance, in making value judgments in the arts. A laboratory analysis of the thoughts expressed by poets and artists while at work suggests that their value judgments most often carry reasons; in this sense their work is nonintuitive. But intuition usually supports these reasons. Finally, far from being at odds, reasoning and intuition seem to be complementary in the complex process of making art."

"10.2307/1573760","An Application of the Water Bell Liquid Flow Phenomenon in Visual Art","Philip Bornarth, Franklyn K. Schwaneflugel","Leonardo",10,"4",1977-10-01,"pp. 265-269","10.2307/1573760","The MIT Press","fla","","The authors point out their interest in the artistic aspects of patterns and forms caused by flowing viscous liquids. In particular, they describe the design, construction and operation of a flow system that produces a central 'water bell' sculptural form. The various factors that influence the form of the sheet of liquid falling from a radial-flow column or stack are presented, as well as the results obtained by adding colorants to the liquid. Photographs of especially interesting examples of the types of flow obtained illustrate their text. A study of artistic form has been produced that is both an example of fruitful collaboration of artist and scientist and of faculty and students in separate academic institutions."
"10.2307/1573761","Computer Art: Pictures Composed of Binary Elements on a Square Grid","Michael Thompson","Leonardo",10,"4",1977-10-01,"pp. 271-276","10.2307/1573761","The MIT Press","fla","","The author describes his procedures for generating pictures by means of a digital computer, most of which consist of black and white squares on a square grid. His first procedure involves the addition of building blocks consisting of a 2 × 2 grid of unit squares, one at a time and row by row, starting at the upper left corner of a picture. This suffers from the disadvantage that a small local change causes a propagation of changes in succeeding rows of a picture. More flexibility is attained with a second procedure in which a picture is initially subdivided into regions and the regions are then filled by the edge-following technique. The design of the computer programs used in this work was developed in parallel with a changing appreciation of the visual content of the pictures. Although this appreciation is personal and vague, it is described at least partially by the model used in the computer programs."
"10.2307/1573762","On Painting Realistically: A Memoir","Anthony Toney","Leonardo",10,"4",1977-10-01,"pp. 277-282","10.2307/1573762","The MIT Press","fla","","The author points out his need to search for and define reality. Alternative approaches by artists to reality are briefly described and his approach is explained. He presents his concept of realism in figurative art as based upon an attempt to resolve pictorially the contradictions he encounters in life and art. The major contradiction chosen then influences the choice of others as well as the interacting levels of the painting's structural relationships. His way of working is described as one of search, generalization, cross-fertilization and sudden recognitions, stemming from previous experience. These lead to paintings containing several integrated meanings. The analytical and synthetic tendencies in his recent work are explained, and a third more allegorical direction, as exemplified in recent murals, is pointed out. He notes the key influences that have affected his work and summerizes his reaction to current social problems in the U.S.A."
"10.2307/1573763","Perception of Perspective Pictorial Space from Different Viewing Points","Rudolf Arnheim","Leonardo",10,"4",1977-10-01,"pp. 283-288","10.2307/1573763","The MIT Press","fla","","After referring briefly to the topological transformations perceived when paintings are viewed from positions other than the orthogonal, the author investigates a problem specific to pictures that are based on central perspective. Central perspective prescribes the distance at which a pictorial construction is projected correctly. But apart from distance, is there also a particular viewing point required for optically correct viewing? A problem arises because paintings are composed with the central vertical of the canvas as the base of reference. That center of the frontal plane coincides rarely with the vanishing point of one-point perspective; in two-point perspective no such coincidence is possible. The author shows that no particular viewing point is demanded by central perspective, and describes the optical and perceptual consequences of various viewing points. A work by Tintoretto is used to illustrate stylistic effects derived from the relation between the center of the composition and the focus of the perspective. The author concludes by referring to the difference between viewers conforming to the spatial experience suggested by a perspective construction and others perceiving the pictorial world 'from the outside'."

It has taken many forms, some of which have proved capable of arousing deep emotion in affected groups, but the information gathered by the author has previously been scattered throughout reference works of heraldry, naval occasions, church architecture, church history and comparative sociology. He intends this article to serve as a guide for writers and painters who might want to include this ubiquitous sigil in their works and to help others in their interpretation of older works."
"10.2307/1573765","On Interpreting Pictorial Art: Reflections on J. J. Gibson's Invariants Hypothesis","David R.

Gibson's article The Information Available in Pictures published in ""Leonardo"" as a point of departure, the author analyzes three hypotheses of pictorial art: (1) the visual, (2) the symbolic and (3) Gibson's invariants hypothesis. Through a study of the first two hypotheses (drawing heavily upon evidence from the history of art), the author concludes that neither of them alone is sufficient for explaining the characteristics of pictures (thus corroborating Gibson's judgment of them), but, as a result of his investigation, the author proposes a symbiotic hypothesis, which combines aspects of both the visual and symbolic hypotheses (which runs contrary to Gibson's complete rejection of them both, or any combination of them), Gibson's hypothesis is analyzed in light of the author's proposed alternative and he concludes that his symbiotic hypothesis is superior to the three hypotheses that have been proposed in the past."

The second author Gert Marcus, an artist, presents in some detail his task of selecting colors for the exterior walls and he explains his basis for making the selection and the composition. He comments on current attitudes toward colored exteriors of present-day buildings, in particular, and toward visual aspects of exteriors in architecture and in city planning, in general. He concludes by drawing attention to his unusual use of colors in recent sculptures, treating a theme that he calls 'Disjunctions'. The theme could be applied on a large scale in architecture, for example in architecture of building complexes."

Influenced by Pop art made in the U.S.A., he adopted the use of large canvases. He traces the change in subject matter treated, beginning with objects from present-day life in industrialized societies and limited views of persons in action, such as a hand holding a cigarette, and terminating in detailed pictures of the tread patterns of automobile tires. He describes his works as representative of his quest for ways of presenting objects in isolation, with the minimum of emotional pictorial content. He believes that his latest pencil drawings are the most effective examples."

The use of linoleum as the plate material for making inkless embossed prints is discussed in detail: the drawing of the design, the cutting of the linoleum, the proofing of the plate during the cutting stage, the selection and preparation of the paper and, finally, the making of the print. In addition, the author discusses his procedure for dyeing the paper from which he makes inkless embossed prints and he describes effective means he has found for displaying and illuminating his dark colored prints. Examples of two of his inkless embossed prints are included."

"10.2307/1573833","Recent Currents in Aesthetics of Relevance to Contemporary Visual Artists","Joseph Margolis","Leonardo",12,"2",1979-04-01,"pp. 111-119","10.2307/1573833","The MIT Press","fla","","The principal currents of aesthetics in Britain and in the U.S.A. from the 1950s to the 1970s are canvassed, Roughly, three movements are noted: reaction in the fifties against the Idealism represented chiefly by Croce and Collingwood; development in the late fifties and early sixties of an increasingly sophisticated and comprehensive Empiricism, most clearly represented by the work of Beardsley, Sibley, and Aldrich; reaction in the sixties and seventies against the inherent inadequacies of aesthetic Empiricism and the exploration in a variety of ways of non-perceptual factors affecting perception itself and the character and appreciation of artworks, represented by a variety of authors including Danto, Dickie, Gombrich, Goodman, Margolis and Wollheim. Developments in aesthetics are linked to more general tendencies in philosophy, to the increasing convergence of British--U.S.A. and Continental European speculation, and to the interaction of art and philosophy. A large variety of fairly detailed conceptual puzzles are sketched, including those regarding the following: the alleged distinctiveness of aesthetic perception, representational schemata, forgery, intentional considerations, the 'innocent eye', conceptual art, relations between physical object and artwork, the individuation and ontological distinction of artworks, relativism and nonconverging interpretations, expressive qualities, the definitions of art, the objectivity of aesthetic judgment, the cultural and historical character of art. The salient work of the principal contributors is identified, including in addition to those within the tradition of Britain and of the U.S.A., representatives of the other chief European tendencies--phenomenology (Ingarden), hermeneutics (Hirsch), structuralism (Barthes), anti-structuralism (Derrida), Marxism (Lukács), The convergence of these various intellectual streams is linked with the developing sense, within British--U.S.A. aesthetics, of the quite specific inadequacies of aesthetic empiricism, defined in terms of what is directly accessible to some form of sensory perception. Finally, the principal conceptual puzzles posed for the various arts are surveyed: the identification and individuation of musical pieces, the role of musical notation, extreme nominalist and realist views of music; the complexity of visual perception, the conventional element of pictorial representation and naturally perceived resemblances; the application of speech-act theoretical analyses to the categories of the literary arts (fiction, poetry and metaphor). Brief attention is paid to current interest among visual artists regarding philosophical puzzles, hence the mutual fertilization of art and philosophy. The developing focal theme of the seventies appears to be the search for an adequate hypothesis for various kinds of artworks, in virtue of which the objectivity and range of critical appreciation may be satisfactorily grounded."

Day after day he watched silica sand and other materials being blown out of drill holes and falling to form mounds having stratifications. The stratifications and the slope angles of the mounds are dependent primarily on such factors as the size, shape, roughness and density of the individual grains that form the mounds. This knowledge enables some understanding of the physical characteristics of the type of kinetic sculptures made by the author. The granular materials employed and the construction of the hourglass-type Plexiglas objects that contain them are described. The article concludes with general comments on this type of sculpture and the author's plans for future work."
"10.2307/1573888","Constructivist Graphic Design in the U.S.S.R. between 1917 and the Present","John Milner, Kirill Sokolov","Leonardo",12,"4",1979-10-01,"pp. 275-282","10.2307/1573888","The MIT Press","fla","","In this joint study of constructivist graphic design in the U.S.S.R., the authors present extracts from the theoretical writings of El Lissitzky (1890-1941) (introduced and quoted text translated by Milner) and of Alexander Rodchenko (1891-1956) and of Solomon Telingater (1903-1969) (introduced by Milner and Sokolov respectively, quoted texts compiled by Sokolov and translated by A. Pyman). The study is made in the context of the optimistic vision of scientific and technical progress that inspired these three artists--and others working in related fields, such as Gabo, Malevich, Chashnik, Suetin, Mayakovsky and Popova--throughout the break-down of industrial development brought about in their country by war and civil war and on through the heroic early stages of reconstruction. In graphic design, constructivists introduced non-figurative patterns suggested by technical diagrams and the decorative use of type-set and photomontage. Lissitzky is seen as a versatile artist whose use of materials and attempts to convey the illusion of 3-dimensionality distinguish him from more dogmatic constructivists. Telingater, who retained a teaching post throughout the period when, as the extracts from Rodchenko's writings show, artists more in the public eye were conforming increasingly to requirements that their work should be readily comprehensible (and therefore traditional in form), is shown as a link between Constructivism and Soviet graphic design today, where the techniques of Constructivism, though not, perhaps, the vision from which it sprang, have been revived by such artists as Vitaly Statsinsky and Vladimir Medvedev."

In his electric light art he has made use of this idea. He explains the ways in which he has employed light beams to produce 3-dimensional luminous images in air containing suspended particles. His first displays involved the projection of a beam of light and its reflection from one point to another in a darkened, smoke-filled room. His subsequent work made use of smoke confined in a viewing chamber with transparent front and rear walls and in a transparent spherical chamber. Beams were projected from slide projectors to produce static 3-dimensional images of tubes in a volume of smoke. Kinetic images were produced in later works by employing a rotating mirror in the path of beams. In the latest work reported, he utilized a cinema film projector and an animation cinema film, prepared for the purpose, to introduce continually changing beams into the volume of smoke. In this work involving motion, the images cast on the walls of the room, wherein the smoke-filled chambers were placed, were also of interest."

The principles that have been commonly used to define the Archaic, Classical, Baroque and Mannerist styles of the West are reduced to outlines for quick reference, with entries for sense of form in terms of proposed principles and for presentation of content in terms of proposed philosophical conceptions. The outlines are considered to be applicable to figurative and to nonfigurative or abstract pictures. The system is intended to provide insights as to the possible classification of pictures in terms of the four Western styles of the past and, thereby, to facilitate a better interpretation of what is seen in them from the point of view of their artists' intentions."

He has produced three different series. In the first, the 'Dehydration' Series, he obtained imprints of fruits and vegetables in cement and he left them in the hardened cement molds to display them during and following their dehydration. Similarly, fresh fish suspended by nylon threads were dehydrated, their shrinkage following dehydration being revealed by tabs on the threads. The 'Textures' series is comprised primarily of shallow imprints of natural objects and artifacts in plaster to display their structural surface characteristics. The series was extended to include photographs of surfaces, such as those on water which cannot be recorded by the imprint technique. The 'Anthropometric' series includes imprints in plaster of parts of his body. His major effort, however, was to obtain 'interior imprints'--that is, physiological records of organs, bones, etc. inside his body. Illustrations are given from these three series and he describes thoughts he has had that induced him to pursue work in these directions."
"10.2307/1573949","Architectural and Textural Characteristics of My Drawings","Michèle Andal, Guy Rumé","Leonardo",11,"4",1978-10-01,"pp. 271-275","10.2307/1573949","The MIT Press","fla","","The artist (M. A.) discusses the style and the execution of the pen and ink drawings that she has made during the past eight years. She explains, in particular, the changes that have occurred in the structure of their penned lines. Her earlier works are suggestive of vague recognizable architectural objects and also of an architectural concept emphasizing parts rather than the entirety of a structure. In more recent works the depiction of objects is no longer emphasized but rather the depiction of materials and of their textures in particular. Recently, she has drawn on surfaces painted in colored acrylics. Photographs of a number of her works are reproduced."
"10.2307/1573950","Discussion of My Sculptures and of an Artists' Community in Italy","Helen Ashbee","Leonardo",11,"4",1978-10-01,"pp. 277-280","10.2307/1573950","The MIT Press","fla","","The author describes the sculptures she has made during the past 20 years from plaster, metal, etc. Her first aim has been to provide objects with minimal visible support so that they give viewers the feeling that they are of very light weight. Her second aim has been to provide rearrangeable groupings of independent units that convey a sense of community relationship between the units. Some of the groupings have units only a few centimeters in height, others as tall as 1.5 meters. She started making these groupings about four years before moving in 1969 to southern Italy, where she and Arno Mandello launched a small community for artists, artisans, writers and agriculturalists. She presents a brief discussion of the materials and techniques she employs and of examples of her sculptures and concludes by reviewing the aims of the community and some of the organizational problems encountered."

Bush","Leonardo",11,"4",1978-10-01,"pp. 281-285","10.2307/1573951","The MIT Press","fla","","Thorstein Veblen (1859-1929), an erudite and unorthodox economist of the U.S.A., is noted for his institutional analysis of economics and is best known for his first book, The Theory of the Leisure Class. Scattered through his several works is evidence of his firm functionalist aesthetic credo, a belief contemporary with and supportive of those of leading designers, architects and theorists. Although an admirer of William Morris' socialist writings, Veblen attacked the Kelmscott Press books as overly precious, deliberately archaic and only within the reach of the wealthy. He predicted that, unless the Arts and Crafts Movement adopted the spirit of the machine production age, it would be no more than an anemic fad. 'Art industry', producing rare and costly goods, merely serves the wealthy, who are driven to display their pecuniary power through the conspicuous consumption of goods and services. Ornamentation, expensive and impractical materials and expensive hand processes are considered evidence of beauty, but there is a confusion between aesthetic value and the use of objects in flaunting wealth. Veblen saw the possibility of a fuller life for each member of society, and this would be achieved through machine mass-production. An economic aesthetic--straightforward, functional simplicity in consumer goods--was desirable on economic and on ethical grounds."
"10.2307/1573952","On Perceiving Paintings and Sculpture","F. David Martin","Leonardo",11,"4",1978-10-01,"pp. 287-292","10.2307/1573952","The MIT Press","fla","","The author states that descriptions of the perception of figurative paintings and sculptures traditionally have been confused by the intrusion of interpretive explanations. Phenomenological description--that is, description as determined as much as possible by the phenomena (paintings and sculptures) rather than by theoretical considerations--indicates that sculptures are perceived in significantly different ways from paintings. He finds that failure to be clear about these differences not only confuses an understanding of these two art forms but, in turn, tends to confuse the perception of them. If painting is classified as a visual art, then sculpture is a visual-tactual art. If painting is classified as a 'static' art, then sculpture is a 'dynamic' art. Painting arrests the spectacle of the world, for painting is primarily about the patina of things, the surfaces of shapes that have already emerged. Figurative sculpture is more about things as they are emerging."

"10.2307/1574002","The Permanency of Artists' Paints: Comments on Levison's Report","George A. Agoston","Leonardo",11,"2",1978-04-01,"pp. 89-96","10.2307/1574002","The MIT Press","fla","","Many new organic pigments are being used in paints for various commercial purposes. A rather large number of the pigments representing a wide range of hues and relatively high chromas possess good permanency. Of these many are of definite interest to artists and, indeed, some are being employed in artists' paints. The author discusses the permanency of artists' paints with emphasis on the aspect of lightfastness. His comments center primarily on H. W. Levison's report of his recent investigation on the lightfastness of test oil paints and test acrylic emulsion paints involving about 100 pigments, most of current or potential interest to artists. Levison's test procedure for the evaluation of color change as an indicator of the lightfastness of paints is outlined and his method for rating them for acceptability is described. Levison has led a long crusade for the use of acceptably permanent pigments in artists' paints and for the ethical labeling of paint containers in disclosing the pigments present. Agoston emphasizes that artists should also be given precise information on the polymers and paint additives employed and the minimum temperature at which polymer emulsion paints may be used. He points to the need for an appraisal both of the yellowing resistance of pigmented (white) acrylic emulsion paints and of the effects of the various additives on their permanency."

After giving a brief summary of polarization techniques and pioneering efforts in using them for artistic ends, the author describes his device for projecting polarized light kinetic displays and artistic polarized light photomicrographs. The non-figurative or abstract and metaphoric qualities of the images are discussed. A comment is made on the relationship between science and art, and polarized light is recommended as an artistic medium."

In generative aesthetics, on the other hand, procedural rules for the production of an artwork are the main determining factor. These procedural rules can also be formulated, on the basis of statistical distribution functions, to specify how a particular artwork should be put together from certain elements. One can also start from the rules of syntax for the joining of macro-elements and translate the relationships into a computer program. By the insertion of chosen parameters, one can have different views of a series of computer generated artworks drawn by a plotter. The author and Klaus Hänisch have used the last method to analyze the complicated rib systems of German Late Gothic vaulting."

The authors have extended the investigations to 3-dimensional constructions of their design. Eight constructions are described and an account is given of the results obtained with human subjects. Differences between the phenomenon perceived in pictures and in the constructions are pointed out and attention is drawn to a new phenomenon--the perception of a subjective or phantom volume."

His active interest in varied mechanical and geometrical problems has led to the making of, for example, a nonrigid polyhedral section for engineering structures; a column of wood that takes advantage of the flexibility of the material; a column consisting of a length of chain held under tension by a series of wooden bows; wooden sculptures having bristle-like 'feet' that 'walk' when they are given a push; typological forms that he calls hyperforms made in plastic; and rotors with self-regulating openings driven by wind. Illustrations of these objects are provided."

He attempts to situate his work as a painter in the larger social context in which he is called to serve through the Association."

The places, objects and people that appear in his work, however, are imagined rather than particular. He explains that color is of primary concern to him, yet he continues to make black-and-white prints. He describes the procedures and techniques he uses in painting and printmaking and explains why his subjects and themes in printmaking usually differ from those in his painting. Recently he has begun to write about art. His book ""Social Realism: Art as a Weapon"" (New York: Unger, 1973) is on the social realist movement in the U.S.A. in the 1930s, and his long essay, Abstract Expressionism: the Politics of Apolotical Painting, in ""Prospects 3"" (New York: B. Franklin, 1977) explores the political and social origins of this nonfigurative style between the 1930s and the 1950s."

Queues of fishes of each colour are swimming along white arcs that cut the peripheral circle at a certain angle. After discussing the kind of symmetry that is involved and the underlying regular tessellations (so cleverly disguised), the author explains why the above-mentioned angle is not 90° but 80°."

In these, emotionally-motivated behaviour, for example, is formalized and social bonds are strengthened and expressed. The author suggests that in human evolutionary history, ritual and art were originally interdependent. Sensuous aesthetic elements derived from functional behavioural, perceptual and physiological contexts (for example, rhythm, balance, ordering and shaping in time, improvising and metaphorical rendering) when combined with ritual ceremonial behaviour would have assisted the memorization and recitation of myth, group history and ceremonial sequences while simultaneously giving physical and psychological pleasure. From such elements (originally in the service of socially facilitative ritual behaviour) more specific and independent aesthetic features could be developed and refined, for their own sake, leading to autonomous artistic activity."

The goals of the project, the introspective reasoning of the collaborators, the content of the prints and the manner in which the content was treated are described. Their belief is that artworks treating scientific and technological subjects not only can give emotional satisfaction to individual viewers but can help them to bring about a better use of science and technology for the welfare of humanity."

The concepts of Alberti, Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci are compared with the current speculations of Gibson and Pirenne. Experimental evidence is reported that reveals that representational pictures possessing linear perspective whose center of projection is at a distance of about 10 times the size of the object pictured are the most acceptable for Western adults regardless of the locations they chose for viewing them. Further experiments with young children show that this preference develops in the early school years, perhaps as a result of increased experience with pictorial materials. The prescriptions of Leonardo da Vinci and Albert Einstein are most clearly supported by these findings."

That the body is the ultimate locus for the change is made evident in the analysis: a shift in attitude toward the body and a new understanding of its status within the dance become apparent. In essence, what was once spiritual becomes fleshly and what was once a subservient instrument becomes a full-fledged reality in its own right. Some suggestions are made as to a possible relationship between the conceptual and the practical framework within which dancers changed dance and the phenomenological method."

Within a period of over 50 years he deviated only briefly in his youth from wood carving to work with Zdeněk Pešánek, the Czech pioneer of kinetic art. In his earlier work he made frequently wood carvings of the human figure. But he finally returned to making reliefs and ornamental objects, which, in effect, was a return to the type of work during his apprenticeship. He discusses his method of working and presents several typical examples of his carvings. His aim is to aid in raising the status of contemporary carved ornamental objects to the level of appreciation that such objects, appropriate to their time, had in the past."

Kitchin, describes his youth in the industrial part of Britain where the Industrial Revolution began. His early sculpture dealt mainly with the human figure in the classical Greek style. When he learned that what he was pursuing was so close to what had been done by Aristide Maillol, his work underwent a major change. In 1959, he made the first principal work that reflected the influence of the heritage of his youth. Working with welding equipment, metal-working tools and machines, he continues to make sculpture stemming from this influence. He describes his recent works, in particular, his latest one, 'Lifting Engine', which is a very large construction whose linkage system permits the disposition of its parts to be changed at will within the limits of its design."

Pochkhanawala traces her development as a sculptor. In her search for a personal style she has had to combat the dual yearnings of one living in post-independence India who wants the material benefits of industrial technology and yet desires to cling to cultural values of the past. She has used various materials, but for the past few years she has restricted herself mainly to cast aluminium. In the series of Metal-Scapes discussed, she focusses attention on sculptural landscapes. Some of them are 'Hymns to the Sea' that borders the city of Bombay and provides it with its only link with pristine nature. A description of her sculptural technique is provided. In Bombay can be found a number of large works she was commissioned to make by the city government and by private industries."

Using a number of examples, the author considers both the historical and philosophical problems raised by such pictures. He argues that pictures within pictures are best considered 'quoted' pictures, and, drawing an analogy with verbal quotations, he offers some suggestions about how to analyze them. He suggests that works by a number of painters can be better understood by seeing what kinds of pictures they choose to 'quote'. Finally, he discusses a special kind of quoted picture treated in a number of recent texts. These pictures contain what he calls 'unconscious quotations'. He explains why the notion of such unconscious quotations should be accepted with caution."

Parallels are developed between natural processes and artistic acts, and the limitations of these analogies are explored."

The set consists of 558 samples; 424 samples represent a regular uniform sampling of the Committee's color space; 134 additional samples halve the size of the differences between colors in the color space occupied by the near-neutral, central-lightness samples. The set is unique; it is designed so that each sample--except for a few limit colors--can be used in the formation of six uniformly spaced scales. The set provides scientists with visual proof of whether the Committee has reached its goal of specifying uniform color scales; it provides artists and designers with a tool with which they can lay out hundreds of perceptually equi-spaced scales, scales that can cut across color space in almost any direction desired, many of which have not heretofore been easy, or even possible, for them to produce."

He discusses three manifestations of death themes in his work: memorials. Vanitas still lifes and Fossil Gardens, and the influence of painters of the past on his work. His use of decalcomania (a paint-removal technique) is explained. He emphasizes his concern with 'universal' themes as subject matter, but, quoting Ortega Y Gasset, he indicates that artists today are often bored by artworks of the past and are not interested in the themes chosen by those who made them."

He summarizes a lecture he gave in Japan reviewing his 30 years of work saying, in particular, how he approaches the making of sculpture, the adaptation of certain industrial techniques and the utilization of granite waste in French quarries. He gives examples of sculptures he made during the mission and of work of the Japanese sculptor Kiyoshi Takahashi. He also discusses some of his experiences that reflect a need for a closer harmony between the works of sculptors and of architects and natural environments. He believes there is a common ground between some sculptors in the Occident and in the Orient as regards the signification of sculptural works."

"10.2307/1574269","The Ecology of J. J. Gibson's Perception","E. Bruce Goldstein","Leonardo",14,"3",1981-07-01,"pp. 191-195","10.2307/1574269","The MIT Press","fla","","J. J. Gibson's approach to the study of perception emphasizes the way an active observer picks up information from the environment. The central postulates of Gibson's approach are that (1) visual space is defined by information (such as texture gradients) contained on environmental surfaces, (2) the crucial information for perception is information that remains invariant as an observer moves through the environment, and (3) this invariant information is picked up directly, so that no intervening mental processes are necessary for visual perception. This paper summarizes Gibson's approach as it is stated in his three books, ""Perception of the Visual World"" (1950). ""The Senses Considered as Perceptual Systems"" (1966) and ""The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception"" (1979) and evaluates the final form of his approach described in his third, and last, book."

An initial influence in 1934 was a Hans Arp relief in painted wood. In 1937 at the New Bauhaus, Chicago, under the direction of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, her preoccupation with materials was encouraged. She presents examples of her early work in wood and glass and also some of her recent large nonfigurative sculptures in bronze and painted welded sheet steel."

He then discusses his use of fiber-cement, a mixture of portland cement and steel wool, as a material suitable for modeling sculpture in which either steel wires or rods serve as internal reinforcement. Structural principles are discussed and instructions with illustrations are presented. Photographs are included showing a selection of the author's works: four sculptures, a mobile, a fishing lure and a stained glass window assembled with reinforced sand-cement."
"10.2307/1574337","On the Idea of Order in the Natural Sciences and in the Visual Arts","Giorgio Careri","Leonardo",15,"1",1982-01-01,"pp. 19-22","10.2307/1574337","The MIT Press","fla","","Focusing not on visual artworks but on processes by which they are conceived, the author identifies order in permanent relations that can be found among data stored in one's memory and that, even if not expressible verbally, can be communicated by means of signs, including symbols. A brief analysis of physical and biological order is provided to indicate that scientific order is the correlation of mutual relations exhibited by natural events that is expressed in a quantitative way based on experiments. Then, following a parallel approach, he proposes to identify aesthetic order in an ensemble of inner relations existing between signs, that is, nonverbal relations that give unity to an artwork. To substantiate this posposal, he offers evidence found in the writings of several painters. He concludes that the ideas of order in these domains are not so different because in science one deals objectively with simplified but quantitively measurable data, while in visual art one deals subjectively with more complex sensory data."

Such a perspective, called perceptual perspective, represents the perspective of visual perception better than geometrical (linear) perspective does. The author's analysis of Cézanne's landscapes demonstrates that Cézanne intuitively employed the underlying concepts of perceptual perspective that provide a rational basis for explaining the geometrical 'oddities' noted in his paintings."

Fish","Leonardo",14,"2",1981-04-01,"pp. 89-98","10.2307/1574399","The MIT Press","fla","","Contemporary colour science and colour art are, for the most part, on separate paths in spite of strong reasons for unity and collaboration. It is argued that this schism is not based on any intrinsic incompatibility, but on causes that are symptomatic of a disorientated culture. These causes are recent in origin and may be classified into those that are common to art or to science, in general, and those that are peculiar to the subject of colour. Prominent in the latter class is the failure by artists to appreciate the importance of distinguishing colour sensations from the external causes of these sensations and the inevitable priority given in science to the objective, rather than to the subjective, aspects of colour. It is suggested that material for a common philosophy, deeper than that of medium or technique, can be found in the study of colour sensation as part of the wider problem of relating private experience to external reality. An important example is provided by a discussion of contemporary uncertainties about the number and nature of colour attributes and of the relevance that this problem has for the visual arts. Some of the author's kinetic artworks and colour demonstrations pertinent to the subject are discussed."
"10.2307/1574400","A Critical Account of Some of Josef Albers' Concepts of Color","Alan Lee","Leonardo",14,"2",1981-04-01,"pp. 99-105","10.2307/1574400","The MIT Press","fla","","Joseph Albers' book ""Interaction of Color"" is widely influential but, according to Lee, has not received close critical attention. Lee undertakes to refute Albers' general claims about colour experience (that colour deceives continually) and to show that Albers' system of perceptual education is fundamentally misleading (Albers 'places practice before theory'). Four topics in Albers' account of colour are examined critically: additive and subtractive colour mixture, the tonal relations of colours, the Weber-Fechner Law and simultaneous contrast. In each case Albers is shown to have made fundamental errors with serious consequences for his general claims about colour and his pedagogical method. It is suggested that Albers' belief in the importance of colour deception is related to a misconception about aesthetic appreciation (that it depends upon some kind of confusion about visual perception). It is suggested that the scientific colour hypothesis of Edwin H. Land should be considered in lieu of the concepts held by Albers. Finally, there are implications for a reassessment of Albers' artworks that might follow a loss of faith in his colour concepts that seem to have been their foundation."
"10.2307/1574401","On My Drawings and Paintings: An Extension of the System of Their Classification","Paul Ré","Leonardo",14,"2",1981-04-01,"pp. 106-113","10.2307/1574401","The MIT Press","fla","","After considering alternative systems for classifying the basic shapes in his drawing and paintings, the author proposes additions to the classification system he presented in his first article in ""Leonardo"". One addition involves a specification of the way in which V-, T- and X-intersections in shapes in the pencil drawings are shaded. Another addition makes use of the Ostwald color system to specify the one, two or three colors employed in the paintings. Also he discusses 'contradictory' aspects of shapes in his drawings and presents a subclassification based upon whether or not the shapes can represent possible 3-dimensional forms. In conclusion, he discusses how two classes of shapes in his drawings can be transformed into forms in bas-reliefs and raised-line embossings. He closes with a commentary on the interpretation of his works."

He then considers ways in which the development of a viable theory might be pursued more successfully. H. Wölfflin's hypothesis and the assumptions on which it is based are discussed. Its shortcomings are pointed out, and an attempt is made to overcome them. In particular, the author defends the assumption that the formal structure of a picture as regards its viewing station point used for the depiction of objects is relevant for the analysis of the meaning of a picture's content. Wölffin's assumption that there are only two such station points that reflect a world view of a historical period (orthogonal (Renaissance) and nonorthogonal (Baroque) to the frontal plane of an object) is extended to include bird's-eye and worm's-eye view station points to accommodate other styles of figurative pictures. Attention is drawn to the opinion of F. Burger that a station point involves spatial and time factors in the sense of impending developments and changes in a culture's world view."

Some of the pertinent terminology and concepts are presented and discussed. Capillary suction is the main force keeping paint in a brush and controlling its deposition on a surface. Rheological properties influence the response of paint to forces acting on it and how paint behaves after application. Generally, it is acceptable for paints that are either rapidly absorbed or evaporated to possess Newtonian viscosity. But it is usually desirable that paints that form thick layers or that harden slowly posses a yield value and display shear thinning and thixotropic recovery."

This updates an article by the author in ""Leonardo"" in 1973. A short discussion of hologram types currently in use is given. Mention of individual artists from various traditional art disciplines now using holography is made to indicate the need for a critique. There is a discussion of the position of artists in the context of prevalent commercial activity in holography. Attitudes towards issues raised by holographic art are described, such as those of technical excellence and of the 'master concept' in which artworks are intended to fit into a hierarchy of quality. Examples are given of the author's holograms combined with other media, of narrative and political types and of those in which an integrative function is demonstrated and used as a theme. Some of her multicolour rainbow holograms are also described. A connection made between holography and Australian Aboriginal painting indicates an influence on her work of the Australian environment."

He points out that his model of a carbon-12 atom possessing an icosahedral arrangement of its nucleons and serving as a building block can be used to produce plausible models of crystals and amorphous clusters of carbon atoms and of hydrocarbon molecules. Although his atomic model does not correspond to the model accepted by physicists, it did serve him in devising his 'force' equation with the aid of a digital computer. A computer algorithm employing the 'force' equation was used to deform networks of polyhedra. Several computer-generated stereograms of networks are presented. He concludes with a short discussion concerning the application of his computer techniques to sculpture and to applications related to polyhedral architecture."

His wall sculptures, generally circular, are constructed by welding together thousands of short pieces of bronze rod, an extremely time-consuming process. After constructing a number of pieces, he felt a need to have a way to produce initial designs in less time. Eventually, he collaborated with two physicist colleagues in designing and constructing the Symmetricon kaleidoscopic projector. The main purpose of the device is to produce with ease numerous images having four-fold symmetry, any of which can be photographed for possible use, for example, in the design of his wall sculptures and other welded artworks."
"10.2307/1574544","On the Progression of My Figurative Drawings toward Higher Abstraction and Outward Simplicity","Paul Ré","Leonardo",15,"2",1982-04-01,"pp. 109-114","10.2307/1574544","The MIT Press","fla","","The author traces the progression of his artwork from his early, complex surrealistic drawings to his present outwardly simple nonfigurative works that were discussed in his previous two articles in ""Leonardo"". Nine examples from his 'Growth', 'Mandala', 'Animal' and 'Abstract' Series are illustrated and discussed. These works are presented as a graphic record of his personal 'journey' toward more wisdom, peace and inner joy. He discusses how his experiments in wind tunnels and training in physics at the California Institute of Technology influenced the streamline characteristics, the kind of abstraction and the analysis of his works. The influences of the Hopi Indians, of pictures by M. C. Escher and of Japanese origami are also noted. A parallel is drawn between his approach and that of Luther Burbank in plant hybridization. In closing, a similarity is pointed out between the developmental pattern of the author's drawings and that of the artworks of Piet Mondrian."
"10.2307/1574545","The Artistic and Aesthetic Status of Forgeries","Tomáš Kulka","Leonardo",15,"2",1982-04-01,"pp. 115-117","10.2307/1574545","The MIT Press","fla","","In the philosophy of art the following question is posed: Can there be any aesthetic value difference between an original painting and a forgery if they cannot be told apart, and, if so, what does it consist in? The author critically examines three currently held views in response to this question, including those of Nelson Goodman. He then turns his attention to both the aesthetic value and the artistic or art-historical value of a painting, both of which may differ markedly. He concludes that if one considers these two characteristics one has a significant basis for resolving the puzzles concerning the aesthetic status of fakes and forgeries."

Her work is related to her notions of time and space, to the idea that to live means to exist between one's external and one's internal world. As one's external world is often limited by the lonely time spent in one's room, her concerns in her work are personal enclosures. She tries to express simultaneity in or between internal and external worlds: how public affairs are seen from a bedroom; how the eyes perceive a shadow moving in a landscape and in memory; how a portrait comes into being between the drawing surface, the artist's hand and the face of the person depicted. Her work, shaped by circumstances and personal inclinations, has developed from paintings that were tightly structural, very colourful and of small size towards monochromatic and loosely structured drawings of large size that closely depict her perception of visual reality."

Logomorphs and Wordforms are the author's terms for the pictures and 3-dimensional constructions he makes whose content is based on either chosen symbols (letters, numbers) or words. Those chosen for a work determine for him its form, medium and technique. Meanings and homonyms of words play an important role. Only conventional letters and numbers are used; however, they may be so transformed that viewers may not recognize them until a title of a work is known or an explanation is provided.

These are activities that find their goal in the activity itself: In the one case, it is the satisfaction provided by the cultivation of aesthetic apprehension, in the other, the satisfaction of understanding of nature for its own sake. Both kinds of activity are in pursuit of order. The order that is the object of the sciences consists in the system of regularities discovered in the external world. The order of the visual fine arts is an inner order provided by artists for aesthetic enjoyment by others. The article compares these two types of order in some detail."

He points out the logical transition from the paintings he made in London to the kinetic artworks produced in Berlin, which involve beams of coloured light in motion. Among the kinetic works described are an outdoor installation involving the programmed projection of coloured light on walls, intercepted by passers-by who cast coloured shadows; an installation presenting projections on fabric sails; an audio-kinetic lightshow, and kinetic electric light objects that utilise dichroic filters to produce divergent beams of complementary colours. In conclusion, he presents a spray-paint picture to illustrate the type of work he is currently making."

Christian Sidenius, discusses the origin of his interest in Kinetic Art utilizing electric light of the type called Lumia by Thomas Wilfred. After a period of working to develop the means of producing kinetic images on a translucent screen, he decided, in 1960, to invite the public to performances in his home of Lumia productions accompanied by music. The favorable response he received to the performances led him to construct his Theatre of Light in 1962. He describes the technical aspects of the theatre and the audience reactions to the performances he has presented. He concludes by mentioning Wilfred's decision to opt for Lumia art presentations without the accompaniment of music and of sounds and his disagreement with Wilfred's decision, pointing out the possibility that the Bauhaus group in Germany, if it had not been dispersed by the Nazis in the 1930s, might have established a permanent theatre of light of the type he has developed."
"10.2307/1574677","Endymion's Moonbath: Art and Science in Girodet's Early Masterpiece","Barbara Stafford","Leonardo",15,"3",1982-07-01,"pp. 193-198","10.2307/1574677","The MIT Press","fla","","This study interprets the natural 'effects' contained in Girodet's 'Sleep of Endymion' against the background of certain scientific discoveries made during the latter part of the eighteenth century. French atmospheric investigations confirmed the existence of a transient ocean of air subject to tides because of lunar influence. Aerial perturbations produced light-related phenomena such as electricity (Endymion's 'charged' form), phosphorescence (his body glowing in the dark) and caloric (a metaphor for the erotic heat of passion). Alterations in the moon's phases were thought to bring about palpable changes in the weather. Moreover, not only does the moon shine by reflected light but the earth, in turn, illuminates the moon's surface--a convenient image for the reciprocity of Endymion's and Diana's ardor. Further, my argument suggests that the view from above-so conspicuous in the later 'Ossian'--is already presaged here. Ultimately, certain overriding Romantic themes are seen as implicit in the painting's imagery: the doctrine of elective affinity, the chemical notion of dissolving, the aesthetic concepts of ekstasis and stillness, and the fecund identification of love with death."

Ernst translated these verbal devices into ways of organizing visual material. He collaged bits and pieces of preexisting images, engravings from once-popular magazines and books, into new and often powerful visual sentences. The form or the relationship between these elements gave the finished collage or painting, painted according to the collage method, its impact. Often wordplays in the titles of works interacted with the plays in the imagery. Ernst also took from Freud's writings his methods of self-analysis, such as the cultivation of spontaneous responses, as methods of locating subjects that would have a significance both personal and modern."

A review of the properties of free and encapsulated liquid crystals is given with emphasis on practical aspects of interest to artists. The increased color gamut and change of color with angle of viewing and ambient temperature are explained. It is shown to be possible to express several aspects or experiences of the the same theme as the angle of viewing or the temperature changes. In a sculpture or relief coated with liquid crystals, inclined planes and curved surfaces are accentuated by a shift in color, as they are seen from a more oblique angle than the surfaces facing the viewer. Unlike with pigments, a layer of liquid crystals is nearly transparent to white light. Only a narrow band of wavelength is reflected and it appears as a relatively pure and saturated color. A great range of color combinations can be created by superimposing two or more colored layers. As the colors of the liquid crystals add, as in the case for colored lights, they open up interesting possibilities for new artistic expression. Photographs of paintings and sculptures that illustrate the above effects are included."

His research, in which chance plays an important role, is characterised by a displacement of the values of each step in making a photograph. Usually, a photograph is produced through exposure to light, and the subsequent chemical operations contribute only to making the latent image permanently visible. But, for the author, the latter become the generator of the image. Light takes on a secondary role. The essential elements in his work are: photosensitive materials, chemical solutions and localizing materials. The techniques are para-photographic; they are more related to engraving, painting, lithography, etc. than to photography itself."

Taking as an example the painting of the 'Dead Christ' by Mantegna, he shows the differences between the actual perception of a real scene and that of the image obtained through the projective perspective technique. In the next section, it is demonstrated that, although 'projective' and 'metric' geometries do not belong to the same basic axioms, they can both be included in an Einsteinian description of space. In the last section, the author analyses the process and physiology of visual identification. He states that the recognition of objects and scenes is dependent on previous experiences of the viewer. He emphasizes the part of photography, television and cinema in the visual experience of today's public. He concludes that, perspective being the image of a volume on a plane, any conventional correspondence is acceptable providing it matches the viewer's visual education."

D. Ouspensky was the trigger that caused the sculptor to create a new type of work which he calls Four-Dimensional Sculpture. The development, method of construction and appearance of these new works are described. Brief reference is made to the relationship between the properties of these sculptures and to both philosophy and visual perception."
"10.2307/1574791","The Mathematics and Computer Graphics of Spirals in Plants","Robert Dixon","Leonardo",16,"2",1983-04-01,"pp. 86-90","10.2307/1574791","The MIT Press","fla","","This is a study of the pattern known as spiral phyllotaxis--literally, ""leaf-arrangement"", but applied to the arrangement of seeds, florets, petals, scales, twigs and so on--and which is very widespread in plants. A number of stages in the refinement of model-making are recorded. In particular, the model illustrated in the literature on the subject indicating uniform growth is taken a step further in generality to indicate non-uniform growth. The intention has been to arrive at a wholly visual statement. And yet the mathematical approach is integral to this end. The study of flower forms becomes a study of the relation between the circle and the golden ratio. A computerised drawing system was used to draw forms that are algebraically defined. This solved a technical problem, but also gave me a glimpse of the enormous scope opened up by this electronic tool. To draw, for example, a simple equi-angular spiral (as found in snail shells) is difficult and time-consuming by traditional means, but elementary by computer."
"10.2307/1574792","Gombrich on Art Historical Explanations","David Carrier","Leonardo",16,"2",1983-04-01,"pp. 91-96","10.2307/1574792","The MIT Press","fla","","This article outlines the major themes of Gombrich's account of art historical explanations, and contrasts his to several other well known contemporary approaches. An analysis of his concept of 'schemata' is used to explain his move in ""Art and Illusion"" from consideration of art telling stories to naturalistic art. Using his contrast between the meaning and significance of a picture, the difference between his approach and the historicist writings of Leo Steinberg and Clement Greenberg is presented. Gombrich is mistaken, it is argued, to imply--as he seems to do--that such historicist accounts necessarily lead to the total abandonment of objective standards of critical judgment. In fact, those accounts explicitly presuppose something like his notion of a canon, an ongoing tradition of art making. Finally, his critique of abstract art is interpreted in relation to the contemporary cultural conditions to which his work is one very important response."
"10.2307/1574793","Determining the Preferred Viewpoint in Linear Perspective","Richard Greene","Leonardo",16,"2",1983-04-01,"pp. 97-102","10.2307/1574793","The MIT Press","fla","","The basic theory of linear perspective is reviewed, and it is shown that a perspective picture implies the existence of a unique point in space which is, on optical grounds, the preferred viewpoint of the picture. The concepts of the visible, terrestrial, and sensible horizons are then compared, and it is found that the horizon in a picture can give the vertical position of the viewpoint. The outside knowledge or assumptions which are necessary in order completely to determine the preferred viewpoint are then considered. The assumptions used here are based on common knowledge of the three-dimensional shapes and orientations of pictured objects and knowledge of the picture-making processes. A step-by-step procedure is then given for finding the location of the preferred viewpoints of one-, two- and three-point perspectives. It is found that a three-point perspective provides more information about the viewpoint, with fewer assumptions, than either of the other two cases. Finally, the reasons why alternate viewpoints may be just as acceptable as the optically preferred one are discussed."

The program, which brought artists and scientists together, was an effort at turning the artist's passive role into an active one by promoting the investigation of contemporary scientific--technological systems and their relationship to art and life. Unlike copier art, which was a simple commercial spin-off, Generative Systems was actually involved in the development of elegant yet simple systems intended for creative use by the general population. Generative Systems artists attempted to bridge the gap between elite and novice by directing the line of communication between the two, thus bringing first generation information to greater numbers of people and bypassing the entrepreneur."

Walker","Leonardo",16,"2",1983-04-01,"pp. 109-114","10.2307/1574795","The MIT Press","fla","","If artists, art historians and critics are to benefit from Freudian psychoanalysis in any way, then they must confront the cental achievements of Freud's work and not just his more marginal writings on art and artists. In order to explain the way in which dream images are produced, Freud introduced the concept of dream-work; it is proposed that a comparable concept--art-work--would be useful in the field of artistic production. Freud made frequent use of the pictorial analogy in discussing the mechanisms of dream construction; this paper reverses the dream → picture relationship and examines, via a number of concrete examples, the extent to which pictures can be elucidated by the terms condensation, displacement, etc. which Freud employed to explain dreams. The underlying hypothesis is that the ways in which dreams, jokes, pictorial and poetic images are constructed are fundamentally similar."

Handsetting metal type necessarily focuses one's attention on the specificity of written language as a sequence of discrete letters. Each has properties of size, weight and shape; and placement and type styles can be widely varied. The technical constraints of letterpress tend to conserve the norm in the representation of language: line after straight line of a single typeface. The author's intention in deviating from these norms has been to extend, rather than negate or deny, the possibilities of meaning by encouraging plural readings at the levels of the word, the line and the page. Other issues such as the relation of language to experience, to literary tradition or to the social context in which it is produced are investigated."

The interaction within some common genres of photography is considered in terms of the contracts and the power balance/imbalance between the person with the camera and the subject in the photograph."
"10.2307/1574907","C. P. Snow's Fiction of Two Cultures","Peter Stringer","Leonardo",16,"3",1983-07-01,"pp. 172-176","10.2307/1574907","The MIT Press","fla","","In his lecture ""The Two Cultures"" C. P. Snow lamented a profound cultural split between scientists and non-scientists in Western Society. Several of his novels also deal with relations between these two groups. It is argued that his rendering of cultural separation is achieved through accounting mechanisms which rely heavily on stereotypes. The way in which he makes sense of the social world closely parallels recent theoretical approaches to the social psychology of stereotypes--a feature which gives a peculiar persuasive power to his world. In ""The Affair"" the use of stereotypes about scientists defeats the novel's capacity to deal with its more important underlying theme of prejudice. It is concluded that the 'two cultures' argument can be read more as a reflection of unresolved conflicts in Snow's texts than as a realistic or normative description of the state of our intellectual life."
"10.2307/1574908","Cézanne's Landscapes and the Functions of Vision","Pavel Machotka","Leonardo",16,"3",1983-07-01,"pp. 177-179","10.2307/1574908","The MIT Press","fla","","Cézanne's paintings have a special quality of close construction: their surfaces are tightly integrated. A study of his landscape sites shows that their organization is only in part imposed. The main objects are taken with surprising literalness from the structure of the motif, while textures are generally ordered by a synthetic process to resonate with the objects. Only by adhering to the structure of the motif does Cézanne release his synthetic capacities. Three suggestions about his personal functioning are made to account for this adherence: strength gained from passiveness in some of his interpersonal relations, dependence on outside structures for his inner equilibrium, and a search for clear relationships in visual reality as symbols of ideal ones in his inner world."
"10.2307/1574909","On the Horizon: Picture Perception and Gibson's Concept of Information","Sheena Rogers, Alan Costall","Leonardo",16,"3",1983-07-01,"pp. 180-182","10.2307/1574909","The MIT Press","fla","","Gibson claimed that the perception of spatial relationships does not depend upon the inherently ambiguous depth cues of traditional theory but that more global informational structures exist in the light surrounding a moving perceiver. This paper examines Gibson's further suggestion that such informational structures can be 'frozen' upon the surface of a picture to be directly detected by the viewer. Sedgwick has proposed that the horizon may provide the basis for important informational structures, and a new experiment is described which indicates that the horizon is indeed an effective source of information in pictures. We were, however, prompted to reconsider Gibson's claim that pictures contain information of a kind available in the optic array. Pictures are a rather special case for perception because they are not natural objects; they are meaningful because they are made to be so."

In this article we focus on ambiguity in the visual arts. We distinguish ambiguity from other related perceptual possibilities such as indeterminacy, paradoxicality and anamorphism. Ambiguous works are shown to be a powerful challenge to two traditional theories concerning the identity of artworks: (1) The subjectivist view that the work is identical with the viewer's experience; and (2) The identification of artworks with material objects. The relevance of some recent studies in the philosophy of art and in artificial intelligence is discussed and, finally, the implications of visual ambiguity for aesthetic evaluation are considered."
"10.2307/1574911","Unusual Pictures: An Analysis of Some Abnormal Pictorial Structures in a Painting by Juan Gris","John Willats","Leonardo",16,"3",1983-07-01,"pp. 188-192","10.2307/1574911","The MIT Press","fla","","A distinction is made between pictures which are unusual because of their subject matter (for example, some surrealist paintings), and pictures which are unusual because they are based on unusual pictorial structures. Two kinds of pictorial structures are described: transformation systems, such as oblique projection and perspective; and denotation systems, such as the use of lines to denote edges. It is argued that Juan Gris and other Cubist painters used both these pictorial systems in unusual ways. This argument is illustrated by analysing Gris' 'Breakfast', 1914. The analysis shows that Gris used a number of unusual transformation systems, including vertical oblique projection, inverted linear perspective and inverted atmospheric perspective. The analysis also reveals the use of a number of unusual pictorial structures related to the denotation systems: the use of false attachments, both within the picture and between the picture and the frame; the reversal of the normal rules for the representation of occlusion; and the use of real surfaces en collage. It is suggested that Gris used these unusual structures deliberately in order to point to, and investigate, the nature of normal pictorial structures."
"10.2307/1574912","The Scientific Study of Artistic Creativity","Gerald C. Cupchik","Leonardo",16,"3",1983-07-01,"pp. 193-195","10.2307/1574912","The MIT Press","fla","","This paper attempts to show that problems associated with artistic creativity are amenable to conceptual analysis within the framework of academic and experimental psychology. It outlines at least three forms of flexibility which may be characteristic of the artist. First, artists appear able to access primitive feelings and memories which are preserved in their unconscious. Second, artists appear able to access perceptual modes and alternate between physical-sensory and object information. This enables them to grasp the world from a new vantage point. Third, artists can functionally separate stimulus input ('seeing as' mode) from motor output ('seeing that' mode) which makes it possible to recreate their new perceptions or images in a concrete work. The fact that these last two skills can be described in the language of experimental psychology suggests that they are amenable to empirical investigation. Experimental psychologists and psychological aestheticians may discover during the next few years just how much they share in common. The former possess rigorous experimental paradigms and a broad theoretical framework which relates the person to the environment. The latter have a rich collection of stimulus materials and access to the people who produce them."

The theory is based upon the role of representational conflict and the natural process of resolving such conflict during mental growth in childhood. It proposes that aesthetic experience in adults re-creates the type of mental and emotional activity that is typical of childhood mental growth. Works of art provide the experience of mental growth and the emotional responses accompanying this growth, long after the initial process of understanding the world has been completed. The framework for mental representation and the resolving of representational conflicts comes from the field of cognitive psychology and the developmental theory of Piaget."
"10.2307/1574914","The Psychology of Abstraction and the Visual Arts","Robert W. Witkin","Leonardo",16,"3",1983-07-01,"pp. 200-203","10.2307/1574914","The MIT Press","fla","","The literature on abstraction in the visual arts identifies abstraction with deviation from, or distortion of, the optical values obtained in natural perception. Thus, it is not only modern art that is said to be high in abstraction but also the art of children, 'primitives' and ancient civilizations. Such an approach to abstraction is an impediment to the development of a proper psychology of the visual arts, one that can be reconciled to the central role that cognitive psychology affords to abstraction in respect of intellectual development. A radically different approach is offered here, which argues that both 'naturalistic' perception and representation are achieved only at high levels of abstraction. A distinction is made between two levels of abstraction, that of typification and that of individuation. The former represents a relatively low level of abstraction and the latter the attainment of a fully abstract level of operation, the initial phase of which is 'naturalism' and the final phase of which is a departure from naturalism of the kind exemplified in modern art. Furthermore, the level of abstraction that obtains in visual representations is held to be a function of the level of abstraction at which sensuous themas and values are to be 'thought' in and through such representations."

To investigate children's abilities to perceive these features, we presented children in grades 3, 5 and 7 with target excerpts adapted from children's stories. Children were asked to choose between a stylistically consistent and a stylistically contrasting continuation. In order to determine whether children would favour stylistic consistency over content, we pitted appealing content 'mis-cues"" against stylistic consistency in half of the perception items. To investigate children's abilities to produce stylistic features, we presented another group of children with the same targets and asked them to make up a line or two that might come next. We examined children's productions to determine whether the style of the target was maintained in the continuation. The findings indicate that children in the age range studied are fairly insensitive to stylistic features of stories, and that they focus instead on content. However, children revealed a greater sensitivity to poetic than to syntactic features. Surprisingly, children who noticed the presence of the stylistic features did not always choose the continuation that was stylistically consistent. These findings indicate that sensitivity to various aspects of literary style, and sensitivity to stylistic coherence, are not fully developed until after junior high school age."

In order to answer this question we first consider the implications of universally valid principles of art appreciation. It is suggested that the application of these principles for predicting the impact of a work of art requires more information than can normally be obtained by either researchers or art reviewers. Next we review the results of guided interviews conducted with artists, art reviewers and interested laypersons. The findings show that the achievements of professional art reviewing outdo the fallibility of artistic value judgments. It is suggested that this fallibility is a necessary result of the nature of art."

Some guidance towards improving our understanding of these may be obtained from a qualitative comparison of persons of recognized creativity in different fields of activity, in this instance painting and physics. On the basis of inferences from autobiographical and working material it was hypothesized that some psychological processes would be common to both of these different individuals and that other psychological processes would be unique. Psychological developments are described up to the creation of the first original products; Van Gogh's 'Montmartre' and Faraday's principles of electromagnetic induction. Psychological findings about major periods of subsequent creativity are not reported. The psychological developments underlying creativity in the two men are constellations of long-term, even life-long, processes. The important periods of choice and decision about the future direction to be taken by creative activity, the consequent reorganization of psychological development and programmes of self-education lasted several decades prior to the creation of the first original product."

The study is centred on a six-month period when the subject underwent a radical, disorienting change in his way of understanding the world. This change is interpreted as a shift in primary constructs. His state of consciousness and the eventual resolution of the crisis are analysed through: (1) A content analysis of his dream diary which showed that during this time there was a more than three-fold increase in the frequency of entries and that the majority of images fell into three broad categories: dreams with images of chaos; dreams with images of compensation; and dreams with images of reorganization; (2) A description of new developments and themes in his sculpture and a major change in his approach to making art. The expanded states of consciousness, the crisis, the increase in dreaming, the dream and art symbols are analysed from a number of theoretical viewpoints, including reference to analytical psychology, dream research and anthropological data.

Successive artists hypothetically must increase the arousal potential or impact value of their art works in order to counter habituation or boredom in the audience. Within any style, this is done by engaging in deeper regression (alteration in consciousness). This leads to increases in primary process content in the works of art produced. When this method becomes too difficult, stylistic change occurs and primary process content declines. Theoretical hypotheses were tested by obtaining ratings of musical themes by 252 British, French, German and Italian composers born between 1490 and 1909. Results were closely in accord with predictions except for the series of Italian composers. Results of a statistical analysis of cross-national stylistic influences are presented."

This test consists of 42 pairs of non-representational figures, drawn by an artist and arranged in such a way that each pair contains an original and a version slightly altered by the artist to incorporate various types of faults. Test items were only accepted after unanimous agreement between expert judges. The score is the number of figures correctly identified as superior. A number of studies are reported from cross-cultural comparisons between European adults and children, and Japanese and Chinese adults and children, showing that preference judgements are very similar between these various groups, and are no more alike between the two mongol races than they are between either of them and British subjects. The test has greater face validity because of the high aesthetic value of the items, as compared with previous tests, and scores are uncorrelated with intelligence or personality, suggesting that visual aesthetic sensitivity is relatively independent of these external factors."
"10.2307/1574922","Laypeople as Architectural Designers","Roderick J. Lawrence","Leonardo",16,"3",1983-07-01,"pp. 232-236","10.2307/1574922","The MIT Press","fla","","In recent years there has been much debate about public involvement in architecture and planning. On the one hand, this debate has frequently led architects, administrators and social scientists to acquire more explicit information about user requirements; on the other hand, rather than treating people as 'objects of research', it is also possible to involve them directly in the architectural design process. Nonetheless, this option has not always proved successful, given that architectural projects are generally documented with two-dimensional (graphic) representations of space, which laypeople have difficulty reading. With the recent development of spatial simulators in a few European countries, which permit full-scale architectural mock-ups to be assembled, it is apparent that not only the role of the building user in the design process can become more active, but also new insights can be gained from the analysis of people participating in the architectural design process. These issues are discussed in this paper, with reference to research undertaken at the Laboratoire d'Experimentation Architecturale (L.E.A.), a full-scale simulator at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, which has been used by members of a housing cooperative to design their homes. The research on this participatory design process has revealed the capacities and shortcomings of laypeople to read three-dimensional, full-scale models, and how past, personal experiences of diverse residential environments have been used as 'resources for design' during the design-by-simulation process."
"10.2307/1574923","Understanding Religion through the Psychology of Art","Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi","Leonardo",16,"3",1983-07-01,"pp. 237-240","10.2307/1574923","The MIT Press","fla","","The psychological processes involved in religious activities can be found in other human activities. Art is one example of human activity in which processes similar to those operating in religion are involved. Through looking at the psychology of art, we may gain useful insights into the psychology of religion. Religion has inspired art much more naturally and easily, and with better results, than any secular ideology, which may serve as another indication of their affinity. We do not deal here with the effect of religion on art as a source of inspiration; it is dealt with extensively in the history of art. The psychology of art assumes a certain unity of basic processes, which are involved in all forms of art. We suggest that the same processes are involved in religion: the process of artistic creation can be a model for understanding the process of religious creation. The individual (and group) reactions to religion can best be interpreted by looking at individual reactions to art. Both art and religion are based on human imagination, and emotional involvement (or emotional 'arousal'). These are the necessary conditions for the existence of both. The psychological processes involved in responding to religion on the part of the audience are similar to the process of responding to art. They include the activation of the imagination and the emotions, and an identification with elements of the artifact presented to the audience. The artistic product creates in the individual member of the audience reverberations, which go deep into the unconscious."

By setting the formal vocabulary of 'abstract' painting into cinematic motion, the form finds itself in a functional dilemma. On the one hand, the spatial ambiguities offered by 'abstract' images go far in compensating for painting's lack of movement, and thus there is no need to add the kinetics of cinema. On the other hand, cinema technically allows images to move, and so the compensation offered by 'abstraction' becomes inoperable. However, the fact remains that certain 'abstract' animations offer a unique expression through which the viewer can visually experience a non-measurable, non-causal and non-sequential sense of time duration. In the article this quality is termed 'temporal ambiguity'. How this expression occurs in animations such as Harry Smith's 'Early Abstraction No. 3', Werner Graeffs 'Film Partitur (Composition I/22)' and Jules Engel's 'Train Landscape' is described. Animations by Oskar Fischinger, Douglass Crockwell and Dwinelle Grant are also discussed."

A brief historical survey presents some basic ideas of Hinton and Ouspensky, two leading fourth dimension theorists. The author discusses the role of the fourth dimension in the theory and practice of 'rayism', drawing analogies between rayism and the techniques of Larionov and Hinton and suggesting that abstract 'pneumo-rayist' paintings are representations of four-dimensional spatial forms. Goncharova's work and mysticism are discussed with reference to Ouspensky. Finally the pictorial device of transparency and rayist manifesto statements are related to Ouspensky's notion of a four-dimensional superman. The conclusion suggests that a causal relationship existed between theories of the fourth dimension and the development of abstraction in Larionov and Goncharova's art from 1912 to 1914."

The objective of this series was to construct temporally based drawings in which the process of motion and structure could be perceived on the surface of a pool. Among the concerns involved in constructing these water drawings was the problem of motion and locomotion as related to the swimmers' movements. Three basic forms of motion (active, passive and static) are explored within the context of the Waterfields performances. The kind of internal experience this swimming event might bring to the performers is discussed in light of the work of phenomenologists and surrealist artists. The psychological, social and architectural aspects of the perceptual experience are emphasized, as is the interaction of the swimmers as they become aware of these elements in the work."

The author later made silkscreen prints, based on the photographs of this event, which he expanded into two silkscreen series. One series was created by printing microphotographic images of Japanese handmade paper, washi, on sheets of washi itself. The other series was created with specimens of plant cell fibers. Since 1982 the author has been engaged in producing a silkscreen print series entitled Polarizing Microlandscape, utilizing a polarizing microscope and a four-color separation photographic process."

The World Man Center on Cyprus was proposed in the 1960s and was envisioned as an artwork containing works of art, enclosed by a work of art, and in large part funded by works of art. As an aesthetic object, it was to be a symbol of transnational poetic creativity endeavoring to transform the everyday, to disclose more of the world, and to bring creative possibility to fruition. This project, although not realized, integrated the architectural design and the land of the site and transformed those involved in its making, who continue to interpret what is real and possible.

In his fragmentary and truncated career he tried to preach and practice a 'synthetic' art capable of objective expression of reality and, through the journal ""Makovets,"" appealed for a return to Goethe's harmonious attitude to the arts and sciences. Art works shown here include sketches for a huge unrealized mural on 'The Resurrection' which, following the thinking of nineteenth-century philosopher Fedorov, Chekrygin conceived of in terms of the Colonization of the Cosmos by an enlightened and transformed humanity. In this article, E. A. Nekrasova gives a brief account of Chekrygin's life and work by way of introduction to some of the artist's own written statements."

With Flat-Sphere Perspective, an image of the entire visual space around an observer can be represented on a flat surface. The system integrates in a coherent and continuous image the many instantaneous views a human observer perceives as he turns his head. This new perspective system furnishes the contemporary artist with a new representational format that corresponds more closely to the geometrical and perceptual principles governing visual perception than any other system hitherto devised."

He recalls how motion captured in these 3-dimensional, light-formed images suggested new possibilities for his work in assemblage. He then gives an account of the development of his work with stereograms, as revealed in technical problems encountered when combining them with real objects, and how, in pursuit of specific expressive intentions, those intentions were conditioned by the problems themselves. Subjects discussed in this connection include: joining stereograms with sculptural materials; the relation of the stereogram projection and film support structure to the piece as a whole; how stereograms shift in relation to fixed objects; the use of found (ready-made) stereograms; ways of altering stereograms by cutting or bending the film sheet, or masking the image with light."

Future trends for Computer Art are considered, in particular the artificial intelligence (AI) potentialities of computers for processing information in a way related to that done by humans.

N. Filonov) to produce a collective work of art. Filonov's work, his theoretical legacy and his educational influence constitute an extraordinary but little-charted area of the Russian 'modern movement', modifying accepted notions of the history of art in the U.S.S.R. The ""Kalevala"" is the one surviving visible monument to the Filonov School; its outstanding artistic qualities give it a place in the wider history of graphic art. In this article Filonov's career, his ideas and the history of his School are outlined. His originality in the field of book design is emphasized. On the basis of hitherto uncollected and unpublished information from surviving ""Filonovtsy"", the contribution of various artists to the finished ""Kalevala"" is assessed, and conclusions are drawn as to the success of the project. In an appendix the summary of the main tenets of Filonov's principles, as printed in the catalogue to the intended retrospective exhibition of 1929, is republished for the first time, in English translation."

He points out that inverted perspective exaggerations that can be found occasionally in pictorial art do not refute his general conclusion about the validity of inverted perspective for the depiction of nearby objects."

However, a remarkable number of artists have remained intensely committed to the veristic. Their written philosophies form a foundation for others to build upon in evaluating the movement. It is suggested that perhaps only through the words of contemporary veristic surrealists can a renewed appreciation of their work be realized and that in these artist-generated writings a rich and viable literature of aesthetics survives a period of misunderstanding."

These began with an organizing system for all phenomena and continued, using water and its tetrahedral molecular structure, as a constant metaphoric link to spatial order. The regular tetrahedron proved significant in modern art/science contexts and led to a first water study (Geometry) and visual experiments concerning art/science teaching and the increasingly complex natural and man-made geometries of spatial order. A second water study (Microstructure) explores dynamic crystallization processes and points out the visual and philosophic contrast with previous tetrahedron work. The tetrahedron ultimately assumed mythological proportions for the artist. Biophysical networks and the geometric continuum are linked speculatively with internal and external responses to (tetrahedral) spatial ordering. The ""unchanging form determining processes"" therein suggest a possible unifying theme for a fragmented society and world."

Moreover, these similarities may account for the special affinity toward music that scientists often display. Contrary to some commonly held beliefs, scientific discovery possesses a subjective, nonrule-governed dimension, and musical creativity possesses an objective, rule-governed dimension. Within the framework of several themes, the author argues for the creative foundations of both science and music and constructs a model that shows clearly the similarities between the overall processes of scientific discovery and musical creativity."

A binomial interpretation is applied to this system wherein each of the subsystems is assigned a designation of success or failure. For man the two alternatives are, respectively, 'decline' or 'flourish', for machine they are 'become intelligent' or 'stay dumb', while for extraterrestrial intelligence the dichotomy is that of 'existence' or 'nonexistence'. The choices for each of three subsystems yield a total of eight possible states for the system. The relative lack of integration between brain components makes man a weak evolutionary contestant compared to machines. It is judged that machines should become dominant on Earth within 100 years, probably by means of continuing development of existing man--machine systems. Advanced forms of extraterrestrial intelligence may exist but are too difficult to observe. The prospects for communication with extraterrestrial intelligence are reviewed."

The patterns evolve and prevail under conditions far from thermodynamic equilibrium in that there is continuous influx of physical or chemical energy. Due to this openness, they are considered model cases for living systems in biology. The dynamics of pattern evolution is governed by nonlinear interactions. In spatial concentration distributions, several geometrical shapes predominate. Their structural elements are singular points, branching points, bands, circles, spirals, helices. These elements and compositions thereof are also found in biology. The authors discuss the significance of regulatory principles in the creation of spatial complexity, which often reveal remarkable aesthetic aspects."

This ancient topic has received a new impetus from research on the automated recognition of form, closely linked to artificial intelligence.

An example of parallel work in science and art is Penman's studies in biology and physics and Nettleship's sculpture. Penman studies subcellular structure, which organizes the biochemical events within cells. Nettleship makes sculpture in which he examines form development and relationships between interior and surface. The main points of comparison in their work are (1) the visual similarity between the observed cell structure and the forms of Nettleship's sculpture, (2) the study of surfaces that are integral parts of interiors and (3) a conviction that organizing principles exist that govern the construction of interior cellular structures and sculptural form. Together their work suggests a reassertion of the central place of form in diverse disciplines."

Historical approaches to this problem have employed various dualisms to separate different parts of the processes that generate form, whether in organismic development, evolution or cognition, and to locate different causes and characteristics in these parts, to one of which is usually ascribed a distinct essence, which is regarded as the generator of distinctive form. A number of these dualisms are examined, starting with that of Descartes, out of which emerges an alternative approach to the problem."

Saunders","Leonardo",22,"1",1989-01-01,"pp. 33-38","10.2307/1575136","The MIT Press","fla","","According to the neo-Darwinist theory of evolution, biological form, like all properties of organisms, arises through natural selection. Those forms that give an advantage persist; those that do not are eliminated. Eventually, therefore, organisms possess only useful forms, and we explain why a form exists by giving an account of how it is useful. The trouble with this argument is that it does not tell us where the forms came from in the first place. We need to know not only what was selected but also what the choice was, what it was selected from. Neo-Darwinists, however, insist that all traits of organisms arise through the selection of large numbers of variations that are small but otherwise random. Nothing can or need be said about their origin, and traits are thus created, not just preserved, by natural selection. In fact, form in biology is created in much the same way as it is in the inanimate world; therefore, it is also to be explained in much the same way. Natural selection gives biology a distinctive character but does not, as so many seem to think, set it apart from the rest of science."

In both cases, one perceives time, mass and space interacting in movement. The movement engenders cadence. Apprehending the cadence of the big and the small, one perceives the harmony and structure of the world. The author considers nature his great teacher. By observing the infinite multitude of the forms of existence, every artist can find the forms and laws of nature that are close to his or her perception."

Leibniz's principle of the identity of the indiscernible' was first taken seriously by Weyl, the theoretician of symmetry. Weyl saw that a test may be possible if perfectly equal particles exist. The symmetry then exists in position space, a space more abstract than real space. However, since the former is only a way of talking about the latter, the absurd collapse would still make itself felt in reality. A mobile made of two equal balls captures it all, generating stunning illusions of switching identities. They become reality if the two balls are perfectly equal. Symmetry is stronger than classical logic."

There was a documented cartoon for a projected painting of the subject, and several extant contemporary copies purportedly reflect it. He executed preparatory studies not only for the figures but also for a variety of marsh, field and woodland wild flowers. These plant studies are remarkable botanical documents, evincing a precise rendering based on a close examination of nature, rather than the traditional flattened forms found in herbals of the period. His studies are unique for a time in which no scientific classification system as yet had been developed for plants, which generally were studied for either their symbolic or medicinal properties, not for their botanical ones. The authors evaluate five of Leonardo's plant studies, which they assume were intended for the ""Leda,"" to determine their accuracy with regard to botanical detail and comparative scale of the component parts, as well as their artistic qualities. The studies are compared with descriptions in modern manuals of flora and with the plants as they appear today in nature.

From the biological and psychological viewpoint this question is rather difficult to answer. A new theory is proposed that tries to link tempo control in music to the neuronal mechanisms of the brain that underlie human time perception and the timing of intentional acts. Elementary temporal experiences--i.e. simultaneity, asynchrony, succession, the subjective present and duration--are structured within a hierarchical model. One aspect of this model is that it allows one to talk about a 'brain-clock' that underlies, it is suggested, tempo control in music."

The period is internally organized on two levels: by the pulse and by the minimal operational values. Rhythm consists in the imposition of cyclic figures--with or without variations--on an underlying period. Rhythmic figures can be defined by a set of five features: mark, durations, morphology, metricity and structure. The dominant rhythmic feature in Central Africa is a contrametric relationship to the pulse, which creates an antagonism between the rhythmical events and their temporal framework. Polyrhythmic music results from the interaction of two or more superposed rhythmic figures, which may vary in dimensions but have periods standing in simple ratios, and its dominant feature is the interweaving of accents, tone colors and/or attacks of the simultaneously performed figures. This gives rise to a conflict between rhythm and rhythm, which is coupled with the antagonism between rhythm and meter characterizing each individual figure. Many of the phenomena described in this paper are current over a much wider area of sub-Saharan Africa."

Both artists and scientists refine this ordering process in their work, by repeatedly comparing the evolving form with spontaneous or intentionally generated sensorial data, until a meaning is felt. The author expands this view-point with particular reference to the visual arts and the experimental sciences, for both of these aim to extend human vision beyond ordinary realism, by imagining new worlds, each standing on the meaning of its own signs."

Composition and the interpretation of depicted material is difficult because only a portion of the material is visible at a time. Collaboration between an experimental psychologist and a practising artist afflicted with tunnel vision has produced two useful ways of effectively reducing the size of visual material, permitting more of it to be seen at a glance. One method uses a video camera and monitor; the other, a less expensive and optically superior method, uses two plane mirrors."

This was expressed in curvilinear geometry with rounded triangles, paraboloids and hyperboloids, pebble shapes with natural polishings, and egg shapes. The use of primary colours again became fashionable: reds, blues and yellows, white and black. This style was strangely uniform throughout Western Europe: one cannot readily identify an object, if unsigned, as a product from Italy, France, Denmark or Germany, or even the U.S. or India."

Using highly reflective materials that are bent in various ways and placed to intersect with direct sunlight, she creates brilliant forms of light that are refracted onto surfaces in the surrounding environment. With the rotation of the earth the angle of sunlight changes, and these light-forms undergo a subtle metamorphosis. The author describes temporary installations at the ruins of prehistoric southwestern American Indian sun-marking sites as well as installations in museums. She also describes the development of her materials from flexible plastic films to permanent materials such as dielectrically coated glass and mirrored bronze and steel. Her current work-in-progress is the ""Sun Drawing Project,"" a large hemispherical structure in New Mexico that will house a permanent Sun Drawing active throughout the full yearly cycle of the sun."

Looking for the specificity of its artistic expression and adopting an analytical attitude, he soon found himself confronted by a limit. In 1978, his work reflected the idea that the photo of a white sheet of paper is a white sheet of paper; the white sheet of paper is what it is--both the photo and the object. In opposition to photography regarded as a tool of the mass media and used as a convincing advertising image, he has explored its meditative, silent aspect. Despite the technical characteristics of this medium, he learned of and joined the tradition that considers silence a creative force. Sketching the general lines of this tradition, he tries to show that the silence in aesthetic contemplation does not mean an escape from the world but rather an opening for conversation."

An urban neighborhood association commissioned the author's first public sculpture, a set of boundary markers built as a political organizing tool. Over the course of building 11 public sculptures, he has observed that putting the skills of a sculptor to work to meet the needs of a group of people who use a public space is a useful way to approach public art. The community's ideas can serve as 'found objects', sources for the sculpture. The author has been able to explore in large-scale work some of the same ideas as those in his non-representational studio sculpture. Sculpture made in the spirit of collaboration with a community is likely to be accepted by that community."

The historical background is traced from A. A. Markov's original formulation through to the present. A digression into Markov-chain theory introduces 'waiting counts' and 'stationary probabilities'. The author's ""Demonstration 4"" for solo clarinet illustrates how these properties affect the behavior of a melody composed using Markov chains. This simple example becomes a point of departure for increasingly general interpretations of the Markov process. The interpretation of 'states' is reevaluated in the light of recent musical efforts that employ Markov chains of higher-level objects and in the light of other efforts that incorporate relative attributes into the possible interpretations. Other efforts expand Markov's original definition to embrace 'Nth-order' transitions, evolving transition matrices and chains of chains. The remainder of this article contrasts Markov processes with alternative compositional strategies."

According to Lissitzky, non-objectivity in art was analogous to the modern concept of number, and the structure of a work of art corresponded to mathematical concepts such as functions and systems. These theories demonstrate Lissitzky's divergence from both Suprematism and Russian Constructivism. Furthermore, the analogies elucidate the artist's insistence on order, his notion of the art-game and the relationship between intuition and intellect in the creative act. An analysis of pictorial space by analogy with real and imaginary numbers and a comparison of art with set theory help clarify the system of the Proun paintings and the theoretical base of Lissitzky's exhibition spaces. They also expand our understanding of Lissitzky's relationship to Malevich's Suprematism. In conclusion, the analogies provide an alternative theoretical base to non-objective art, different from the other 'isms' of art in the 1920s."

The system analyzes viewers' responses to different combinations of graphic variables and uses this information to iteratively display, test and refine pictures most attractive to the viewer. Images are created using empirically developed variables, which include number, size, variety and position of picture elements, along with color, complexity and regularity. Based on several graphic features defined by psychologists, art historians, and designers, these variables also relate to computer-graphics generation methods. The reliability of a proto-type system, the Adaptive Graphics Analyzer, is supported by viewers' preference ratings for over 1,500 image stimuli. The authors hope that findings from this system eventually will be incorporated into theories of aesthetics and effective visual communication."

The artworks of Cézanne and van Gogh are cited as examples of a painted cosmic code, and Kandinsky's preoccupation with the proto-element of painting, the point, is discussed. Theoretical discussions by artists Malevich and Lissitzky as well as the work of theorists Duane Elgin and Teilhard de Chardin are reviewed in the context of the cosmic code and its relation to the theory of 'continuous creation' in the cosmos. Both historical and contemporary examples of artistic and scientific research illustrate the similarities of 'cosmic code' experience with varied types of works."

Such procedures that exploit the new technological media strive to redefine our relationship to the world in the global context of communication. They propose 'representations' that originate beyond the real, beyond appearances and beyond ordinary perceptual frameworks. The artist's primary function shifts from the production of objects to the creation of models and systems. We are beginning a new era in our relationship to the sensitive, the imaginary and the symbolic: that of the aesthetics of communication."

One of the most important transformations has to do with the role of communication in the definition of matter and reality. As a reaction to their changing environment, many contemporary artists are using the newly available tools of three of today's most important technologies--video, computers and communications technology--in their search for new forms of creative expression. Video art has evolved from artists' use of the tools of television for their own creative ends. Computers offer unlimited possibilities for image generation and the manipulation of vast quantities of information in the creative process. Communication technology allows interactivity in both these fields as well as the creation of new work spaces that eliminate distances between collaborators."

The informality and interdisciplinary nature of the discussions contributes new and valuable insights into Xenakis's work. Xenakis's dialogue with Messiaen is of particular interest, because of Xenakis's extraordinary rapport with his former teacher, and because of the unusual candor with which these two composers spoke."

This doubly contradicts nature. The Second Principle of Thermodynamics states that information contained within nature tends to be forgotten. Living organisms contradict that principle by preserving and transmitting genetic information. They constitute a memory in defiance of the entropy of nature. Mendel's biological law states that acquired information cannot be transmitted from organism to organism. Our species contradicts that law by having an elaborate cultural memory, progressively storing acquired information to which successive generations have access. This double negation of nature, although only temporary, constitutes the human condition. Human dignity, which distinguishes us from all other known beings, can be defined as the fact that we have both a genetic and a cultural memory, that we are 'historical beings'. Human dignity will acquire new meaning as electronic memories radically transform our cultural memory. This article considers some aspects of that transformation."

These media are part of a perceptual continuum that began with the Industrial Revolution and reflect its mechanical and scientific extension of the human ability to create a visual microcosm. A capacity for literal mimesis also existed at the juncture of art and science of that period. This interdisciplinary relationship gave rise to a belief that a description of reality was a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of objective 'truth'. Thus, from the beginnings of photography, the objectivity of the photograph was often conflated with the structure of the reality it rendered. Although digital photography is like its nineteenth-century predecessor in this regard, its origins in computer science and its links to the graphic arts and constructivism also help to define its content and style."

He uses the way we visually interpret images presented on a flat surface through physiological and psychological depth cues to introduce the paradox of a flat holographic surface displaying a three-dimensional image. In presenting a diagrammatic explanation for the space displayed by holograms, he focusses on the technical developments of the holographic process, the viewing zones generated by holographic plates and the restrictions imposed during the recording process."

The study of art history is a common requirement in most studio art programs. Similarly, photography students are usually introduced to the history of that medium early in their training. This is not always the case with holography, which often emphasizes technique and process. To study the various stereoscopic formats of the past is to understand previous uses for some of the effects that characterize holography. An understanding of why these earlier imaging systems fell out of use can help the student holographer avoid the same pitfalls. The goal of this essay is to increase awareness of the need to get past the novelty of the medium. Only then can the student of holography come to terms with the expressive potential of depth, color, movement and parallax that defines the holographic image."

His experiments with black-and-white and Benton white-light transmission holography are described. He writes about his pioneering use of Holographic Optical Elements (HOEs) in the image-making process that results in animated imagery and his transition from geometric abstracts to organically based compositions. The artist also discusses the improvisational techniques necessary to his involvement in this relatively new and evolving medium, and the technological and conceptual considerations of holographic art and high-tech art in general."

Creative holography is not necessarily seen as 'artistically good' holography: 'creative' refers to a certain approach to making display holograms, the end product not automatically having any consequent artistic merit. The question of what makes some holography fundamentally creative is worth consideration if only because such holography requires a different response from the viewer."

He observes various scientific and artistic techniques in different epochs and cultures, which bring to light some interdependencies of ancient visions and new perceptions of technology and art."
"10.2307/1575389","Holographic Holography","Shunsuke Mitamura","Leonardo",22,"3/4",1989-01-01,"pp. 337-340","10.2307/1575389","The MIT Press","fla","","The main theme of this article is a new vision of art using holography. The author criticizes the solidity of objects and explains the reasoning behind the need for spatiotemporal art. His motivation to study three-dimensional art comes from his fascination with space in this transient world. He describes the development of his spatial works from his early mirror constructions to his recent holographic installations. He also discusses the meaning of holography and suggests a plan for future artistic experiment."

Rallison","Leonardo",22,"3/4",1989-01-01,"pp. 341-342","10.2307/1575390","The MIT Press","fla","","People who work at creating holographic art have to overcome many obstacles prior to meeting with even a modicum of success. They must usually do so with a minimum of outside help, experts being rather scarce. A mountain of equipment and a substantial facility and budget are required for the more ambitious undertakings. These obstacles have not deterred a few particularly hardy pioneer types, such as Paula Dawson of Sydney, Australia. She tackles life-size objects routinely and unrelentingly on a scale that some would claim to be impossible. The technical achievement is secondary to the artistic messages in her work, but the scale is necessary to properly make the statement. This paper applauds the hardy few who have reached their goals and gives encouragement to those with yet unfulfilled dreams."
"10.2307/1575391","Rubies and Rubbish: An Artist's Notes on Lasers and Holography","Carl Fredrik Reuterswärd","Leonardo",22,"3/4",1989-01-01,"pp. 343-344","10.2307/1575391","The MIT Press","fla","","In 1962, the Swedish-born author, who was 28 years old at the time, had the good fortune to meet Billy Kluver, who took him to the laser department at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey and introduced him to the magic power of laser light. The author immediately saw the chance to use this revolutionary and precise tool for his poetical and philosophical investigations of life."

This freedom has allowed the author to produce a series of monotype works, including large-scale pieces, with rainbows mixed from spectrally pure colors to pastel tones. The imagery, combining shadowgram, photogram, found object and text, renders a non-linear narrative emphasizing the privacy of the act of perception."
"10.2307/1575393","Holography and Art in a Research Laboratory: A Retrospective","Claudine Bainier, Gilbert Tribillon","Leonardo",22,"3/4",1989-01-01,"pp. 349-352","10.2307/1575393","The MIT Press","fla","","The authors' laboratory in Besançon has been conducting research in holography since 1965. In 1976, it produced the largest holograms being made at that time; as a result, the laboratory became well known around the world, and many requests from artists interested in this new means of expression were received. In 1978, the laboratory developed a new technique allowing the recording of animated portraits by a pulsed laser. The application dealt with repetitive sequences of animated holography. Focusing on the laboratory's experiences with advertising and art from 1975 to 1982, the authors describe successful collaborations with three different artists."
"10.2307/1575394","""Choice and Circumstance"": A Collaborative Art Project","Sydney Dinsmore, Melissa Crenshaw","Leonardo",22,"3/4",1989-01-01,"pp. 353-356","10.2307/1575394","The MIT Press","fla","","In discussing their holographic installation ""Choice and Circumstance,"" which was designed as a collaboration, the authors examine the concept development, technical production and finished artwork. The installation is composed of white-light reflection holograms set against large-format photographic murals. Conceived as an installation in four parts, or tableaux, the work chronicles emotional response through gesture and suggestion. Drawing on current social and political attitudes, ""Choice and Circumstance"" endeavors to visualize some specific complexities of timeless relevance."
"10.2307/1575395","Treading on the Tail of the Tiger: A Collaborative Effort in Large-Format Holography","Suzanne St. Cyr, Sally Weber","Leonardo",22,"3/4",1989-01-01,"pp. 357-364","10.2307/1575395","The MIT Press","fla","","The authors discuss the installation Alignment, whose simple elegance rests on a foundation of technical complexity. One of the fundamental components of this work is a holographic optical element 80 in high by 40 in wide. In holography, an increase in scale coupled with a demand for precise color control can escalate technical difficulties exponentially. To meet the technical, conceptual and aesthetic demands of this work, two holographic artists collaborated to develop a holographic design system that reduced the time and cost of experimentation. Many elements of this design system eventually were incorporated into an interactive, matrix-based HOE computer-design program. Using this design system, the authors exploited the technical capacity of holography to produce a work that would have been impossible in any other medium."

Boone","Leonardo",22,"3/4",1989-01-01,"pp. 365-368","10.2307/1575397","The MIT Press","fla","","The author describes his efforts to bring holography and its artistic applications out of the realm of mystery or curiosity. Three areas of the author's involvement are treated: first, how holographic portraits were successfully made in situ during a convention (it is believed that this was a world's first); second, how holograms of simple vegetal objects, viewable under normal lighting conditions, are being used to bring holography to a larger audience; finally, how collaboration between technicians and artists can lead to results that are satisfying and enriching for both parties."

The use of laser transmission holography for portraiture is contrasted with that of reflection holography. The author discusses the interaction with subjects in a darkened holographic studio, the manipulation of visual depth and the technical difficulties in producing a hologram."
"10.2307/1575399","Holography and the Imaginary Double: The Image of Body","Philippe Boissonnet","Leonardo",22,"3/4",1989-01-01,"pp. 375-378","10.2307/1575399","The MIT Press","fla","","The kinship that holograms have with hallucination and mirage leads the author to a theoretical reflection on the imaginary Double as related to the image of the body. This correspondence to the archetype of human thought is one of the main formal specificities of pulsed holography, besides of course the illusion of the third dimension. The author uses this correspondence as a means of discussing the contemporary tendency of art and culture to reduplicate themselves, thereby almost creating their own imaginary Doubles."
"10.2307/1575400","Studies on Holographic Anamorphoses: 500 Years after","Brigitte Burgmer","Leonardo",22,"3/4",1989-01-01,"pp. 379-382","10.2307/1575400","The MIT Press","fla","","Holographic anamorphosis is based on the geometric theory of optical imaging. Under certain circumstances there is not only a hidden but an obvious relationship between anamorphoses and holograms. Due to the unique storage system of holograms, the author feels that, in studying the nature of holograms, one should take anamorphoses into consideration. While a photograph records a subject point to point, in a hologram the information is spread across the film. An anamorphosis can be represented in a drawing construed on a two-dimensional surface or, as explained in this article, in a hologram of a three-dimensional subject. The author experimented with an anamorphic drawing by Leonardo da Vinci, which is considered the oldest documented anamorphosis."
"10.2307/1575401","Holosculptures: Holography and Sculpture, Spirit and Matter","Georges M. Dyens","Leonardo",22,"3/4",1989-01-01,"pp. 383-388","10.2307/1575401","The MIT Press","fla","","Sensing the close relationship between sculpture and holography, the artist fused these media, adding electroacoustic music and fiber optics to enhance the overall impact. He thus created what he refers to as 'holosculpture'. While working to integrate sculpture and holography, he found that the brightness of the holograms did not allow the sculpture to be viewed properly. The solution was to show the sculptures and holograms alternately, which he achieved by using electronically operated lighting systems. As an important consequence, his works now are not only displayed in space but also evolve through time, thus becoming more theatrical and spectacular."

She describes some of the 30 large-format transmission and reflection holograms created by herself and her husband, Greg Cherry. She also discusses her aesthetic and philosophical intent, traces subject development and provides technical information. Computer-animated laser scanning on phosphorescent silkscreens is also described."

This article briefly describes holopoems made between 1983 and 1988 and then focuses on the fractal holopoem ""Quando?"" (When?), co-authored with computer artist, Ormeo Botelho. The authors present the basic concepts of fractal geometry as a tool for the creation of holographic art and show how it was used for the elaboration of Quando? In a technical appendix, they describe the process of digitally synthesizing a fractal holopoem."

The application of holography to stained glass has given rise to a whole range of new possibilities. By joining together different holograms, the author uses modulated reflected light, rather than transmitted light, to bring life to a wall. An analogous scheme can be followed for floor tiles."

However, any truly useful analysis of the unique aesthetic message of holography first has to deal with the medium itself and the investigation of its inherent autonomous structure. Holography really should be understood as a specific aesthetic expression of our times that opens us to a new perception of our philosophy of life. The author demonstrates some parameters of the autonomous structure of holography. The aesthetic message of the medium discussed in that way is distinguished by an immediate paradox: the holographic image appears to be a normal picture, but simultaneously the illusion of the image that normally would be expected is completely destroyed. Consequently, the traditional difference between image and reality in general is overcome and cancelled. Thus holography makes a radical break with geometric, perspective optics. At the same time, the predominant paradigm of objectivity as an illusion of reality is revealed."

The chrome helmets of three women's hairstyling chairs were fitted with 11-in monitors. Computer-controlled imagery routed to the monitors from three source VTRs documents various aspects of the relationship between women and developments in technology: technology and women in the work-place, women in scientific and technological research and women working with domestic technology such as household appliances. The juxtaposition of this imagery using computer switching encourages an awareness of the diverse roles that women occupy within high-technology Western culture."

The author sees himself as a generalist with specialties. For the past several years, his specialties have been primarily concerned with luminism and kineticism. Because of his involvement with luminism, he has developed considerable expertise with electric gas discharge tubes, or 'neon', resulting not only in aesthetic but technical innovations as well. He describes here his portable neon fabrication system, which has made possible projects and installations previously thought too difficult or unfeasible to pursue."

This is a familiar theme in painting for the art market, but perhaps it has been even more systematically explored in images made in scientific work. The author contrasts exact recording of three-dimensional shape in objects, seen in many representational, perspective pictures for science, with planar abstract patterns, which emerged from experiments on such phenomena as light, magnetism and electricity. The contrast between these two types of scientific imagery, representational and abstract, conceals connections between them, some of which the author discusses."

At the same time, computer art will develop from a minor, derivative medium to one with its own distinctive (and as yet mostly unimagined) characteristics. New opportunities will abound for the artist to develop the possibilities that the computer presents. Programming is the most effective way to explore and develop these possibilities. It should be taught to artists in a way in a way tailored to their visual orientation, perhaps using one of the new versions of computer languages that make visual programming less frustrating for the novice. Artists should also make a contribution to software development in general."

Rigby","Leonardo",24,"1",1991-01-01,"pp. 53-62","10.2307/1575469","The MIT Press","fla","","This article is mainly concerned with visual mathematics: the delight of regular colourings of patterns and the way in which shapes (some of them strange) fit together. A regular tiling, such as the tiling of squares or of equilateral triangles, is made up of regular shapes fitting together in a regular way. It is sometimes possible to combine a number of regular tilings to make a regular compound tiling: imagine the tiling drawn on transparent sheets and laid on top of each other. There is a close connection between regular compound tilings and tilings in which the tiles are coloured to form an orderly, regular pattern. But regularly coloured tilings, usually called perfect colourings, are not always associated with regular compounds in the normal sense. The author's discussion of the surroundings of the hyperbolic plane encourages the reader to contemplate tilings made up of tiles that are not regular, or made up of tiles that are regular but infinite and much more complex than the regular polygons of elementary geometry."

Intelligence participates in this activity by helping to define goals in knowledged-based selection from among many options, while the aesthetic component structures outcomes, endows them with expressive power, and facilitates communication. Artifacts qualifying as works of art embody human intelligence and sensibility, as well as the experience of aesthetically applied technology. Imitation of past artistic paradigms, even when new technologies (computer-based or not) are used, precludes the discovery of new sources of beauty and thus precludes originality. The expansion and redefinition of the artistic universe that new science and technology make possible have already resulted in a broader notion of art and in new forms of artistic activity. Consequently, our concept of beauty is emancipated and expanded to include the beauty of scientific theories, some requiring visual means of expression that only new technology makes available."

In this article the author describes his personal attempt to transpose the basic rules of music (rhythm, notes and sol-fa) into painting on a formal basis: times and bars are transposed into spatial elements (lengths, angles or surfaces); notes are transposed into lengths proportional to their frequencies. This formal basis acts as a score, providing a structure for abstract pictures that are 'interpretations' of pieces of music. The bars are placed on basic lines. These lines transpose the time needed for listening to the piece. Shapes of the basic lines and colours attributed to the notes follow rules of interpretation. Up to now, the aim of his research essentially has been to interpret classical and romantic music in painting."

The analysis utilizes 14 quotations from Martin's writings that uniquely specify the structure of the screen print. Within a wider discussion of cubist and constructivist art, the author suggests that artworks of this type negotiate a problematic relationship between functional aesthetics and fields of inquiry concerned with language, action and interpretation of experience. The analysis concludes with an examination of Martin's ""Chance and Order"" project vis-à-vis different philosophies of space and time."

First, he was convinced from an early period in his life that there was an urgent necessity to establish contact between engineers and scientists through applied mechanics and applied mathematics. Second, concerned by the lack of a regular exchange of information and ideas between engineers and scientists of different nationalities, he was dedicated to the goal of establishing international organizations; among his achievements in this arena is the International Academy of Astronautics."

The author suggests an original method of classifying the arts that makes it possible to simultaneously graph both the expanding 'universe of the arts' and the centripetal tendencies that characterize the integrity of the arts system. He discusses the types of interactions that occur between the different kinds of art forms, as well as the inevitability of strengthening synthetic trends in the artistic culture. The author's analysis of contemporary technical means of audio-visual communication, together with his system of classifying the arts, is conducted in light of S. M. Eisenstein's conclusions about the dialectical unity of the 'progressive-regressive' trends that determine the synergy of thought and feeling in art."

The work goes beyond the boundaries of a conventional exhibition of painting and sculpture in various ways. The artist parodies the analytical methods of anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists and art historians. He presents work patinated to suggest antiquity and emphasizes deception, obscurities and satire, strategies aimed at stimulating audience involvement. In contrast to the convention of exhibiting painting and sculpture in passive environments, contrived to eliminate interferences and to foster atmospheres of contemplative acquiescence, the exhibition environment described here was designed to heighten ambiguity and dubiety by alternately strengthening and weakening the credibility of the invented civilization. The disruptive effect of planned interference is mollified by the cohesive use of sound and music, compiled and composed to function as an element unifying the whole experience."

He developed the conviction that significant art could be made by using the most elementary media--a conviction confirmed by the history of art. Establishing certain basic constraints, he began to draw a series of crow-quill black-and-white images, inspired in part by Picasso illustrations and also by mathematical coordinate plots. He named the new art forms 'schemas' because they reminded him of schematic diagrams. The author analyzes the elements of his schemas, using examples culled from the hundreds he has created over the years, and shows how they evolved into color images. His position is that an artist need not use advanced media, such as computer graphics, to create a new and important art form."

The pleasure of discovery animates this search for a distillation toward the purest statement of form. In the second phase, the leap from outside to inside becomes the conversion of lively and complex figurative and mechanical elements into a peopleless world, re-emerging newly abstract as a mini-universe of disembodied skull, spine, heart and bone shapes, and as an array of gears, cogs and wheels that blends with geometrical and numerical shapes. Color is subject to a parallel process of reduction, playing an integrating role in forging the unique identity that gives definition to the painting. Form and color fuse in attaining the below-the-surface life of the figure and the machine, thereby introducing new pictorial elements and stimulating new visual ideas--in essence, a system of symbolic abstraction."

Four independent artworks are documented, three of which are phases of development toward a major interactive production. Each phase in this continuum triggers the next phase, hence the term 'process art'. In tracing these steps the author explains how the viewer interacts with the work. The interaction becomes a collaboration. In this interaction, participant responses are the material, the 'paint', to be manipulated and applied toward creating an artwork. The application 'brush' is the computer that generates a text or graphics output. The installation site is the 'canvas' where the work is viewed and experienced."

Such a model, while making moot the question of cause and effect, may account for correlations in art-historical phenomena. Sigmoidal growth is characterized by initial slow growth, followed by rapid growth and eventually limited by saturation. Both behaviorism and cybernetics are based on a feedback model; thus, it is proposed here that the perception of historical 'movements', 'periods' and 'styles' is the result of sigmoidal phenomena, which in turn are related to feedback mechanisms."

Videotapes generated on the Sandin Image Processor have been exhibited internationally and have received numerous festival prizes. However, these artworks and the circumstances of their making have only been sparsely documented.

The author examines the relationship between Mandelbrot's theory of geometry and his theory of aesthetics and notes that this intervention is dependent on a displacement of contemporary critical visual practice, a practice that, once restored, affords the opportunity for a critique of scientific theory through the visual register. The author concludes by suggesting that Mandelbrot's claim of novelty of intervention may have at least one historical precedent."

In this exploratory micro-analysis, professional and skilled amateur portraitists were videotaped while they drew portraits under six different experimental conditions, defined by time allotted to complete the work and the presence versus memory-recall of the models during the drawing phase. The amount of attention devoted to 22 different areas of the face and abstraction and distortion in the rendering of facial features were computed from the videotapes and statistically analyzed. Also, the portraits were rated in terms of pleasingness, interestingness and the degree of abstraction and distortion. Among other findings, the artists used fewer strokes and rendered more abstract portraits when they drew with a model present than when they drew from memory, and the portraits rated more abstract were also rated more pleasing and interesting."

It would appear that these compendiums have much in common with the design and operation of mail-order catalogs. One of the hallmarks of recent postmodern thought is the conflation of art and mass culture, thus implying that the appearance of the sign is contextually bound in terms of its function. While some art catalogs aspire toward a popular model of representation, others attempt to read as theoretical texts divorced of any of the presence engendered by the exhibition. This essay argues in favor of a balance between a popular format and an adequate theoretical text in order to give the catalog the role of a vital form of art documentation."

Granville","Leonardo",24,"3",1991-01-01,"pp. 351-354","10.2307/1575581","The MIT Press","fla","","The author describes how colors of some familiar objects and scenes shifted when viewed with one of his eyes after a lens implant, compared to the other eye without implant. Estimates of the shifts are described with common color names. Some of the shifts were spectacular. Variations in the spectral transmission of the lens are believed responsible for the shifts. Implications affecting the choice of colors for interiors, fashions and other design uses are discussed. Appendices contain observations on additional colors and data for matches on the Glenn and D & H Color Rules."

Through discussion of this question the author suggests a universal concept of symmetry as a social theory of perspective that is oriented by deepening human understanding. By applying these ideas to the relations of nations, he proposes a special concept of symmetry as a perspective to prevent wars by means of a balance. In the context of this vision of symmetry the author describes his proposals for two monuments of peace: a Berlin memorial Brücken des Lebens (Bridges of Life) and an earth memorial Große Konföderation im Kreuz (Great Confederation in the Cross)."

Originating in China, the craft was further developed in Italy, where it was practiced in secrecy within family lineages until the advent of new technologies radically transformed it into pyrotechnics, or the 'science of fire'--today ranging in application from safety matches to booster rockets. The author discusses the revival of the attendant art forms with twentieth-century technology and how these forms relate to performance art in this century."

He shows that contemporary Soviet computer music came into existence on the basis of achievements in the sphere of electronic music. Experiments in electronic music began in the 1960s and opened up a great number of new, unprecedented timbres for Soviet composers. At the same time, use of computers in structural musicology, folkloristics and psychoacoustics produced some fundamental works that revealed new ways of looking at musical perception and hence changed the way modern composers looked at musical form. The author also provides brief portraits of 15 Soviet computer composers and meditates on the future of computer music."

Could the sexual body be represented as an ontologically transparent skin through which art and science are mutually visible? These questions are posed by the author in the form of cross-disciplinary works: original biological-visual research into the development of the genitals in the human embryo, 3D models, drawings, videos, paintings on the body and didactic lecture-performances. The works draw upon disparate fields of knowledge--linguistics, psychoanalysis, the histories of visual art and biological science, the subjectivity of the artist--to propose alternative terms for the construction of sex, sexuality and gender during this time of crisis in sexual difference as it stands at the intersection of feminism, science, art and politics."

These ratios are constant for a particular curve and form the basis for calculating the acute angle β between a tangent at any point on the curve and its polar radius vector--each spiral has a unique β. The magnitude of β controls the sweep of the curve, and the closer this angle β is to 90° the tighter the spiral. For the Nautilus pompilius illustrated in this paper, the average growth-ratio of radius vectors, for θ = 90°, is in the order of 1:1.3158, which yields a constant angle β of about 80°."

This method involves the use of a digital image of an original artwork that is viewed on a computer monitor and processed by computer software that reads the coordinates of points in the artwork. Once measurements have been expressed in terms of the coordinates of points on the digital image, perspectival analysis is obtained by algebraic calculations. The authors used this method to analyze the perspective of the painting ""The Flagellation of Christ"" by Piero della Francesca. Results include the determination of the vanishing point and of the projection point."

Following a brief discussion of issues, the authors report on a study that explored how viewers responded to a painting under different titling conditions. Viewing the projected image of a painting while hearing the title spoken, individual subjects talked about what they were seeing and used a flashlight pointer to indicate where they were looking. In this study, the change of titles affected individuals' interpretive readings, as determined by their descriptions of the paintings, but not where they looked. These findings suggest that with change of title, spatial organization may remain relatively stable while other aspects of the person's experience of the painting change. The authors suggest that the findings of this kind of research bear on broader theoretical issues of word/image relations as well as questions about how to display art in public places."

Various modes of the paradigm are available in cognition, expressed through a hierarchic, dialectic repertoire of attentional states. Paying attention to events construes them in a presumed spatial sense of context, some of which are invested through graphic media in common-sense models of social transactions. In terms of the pragmatic paradigm, Cartesian dualism is rendered as a consequence of attentional behaviors tutored in a cultural milieu dominated by print graphics. Electronic and photonic technologies radically revise familiar attentional modes, inducing a new and more complex pragmatic of imaginal being. In a telecommunications environment, art is less about making valuable objects and more a matter of attentional curiosity."

A particular kind of formal grammar, called a shape grammar, has been used widely over the past decade to understand the spatial composition of designs in architectural and other languages. Recently, an extension to the shape-grammar formalism has been developed that allows qualities such as color, texture, material, function, and so on, to be incorporated into the rules of a shape grammar. This new kind of grammar, called a color grammar, can be used to represent simultaneously the composition of spatial and qualitative aspects of designs. Simple, pedagogical examples of color grammars are presented. Issues that arise with the representation of color or other qualities in grammars but do not arise with the representation of spatial form are discussed."

He posits that aesthetic meaning requires greater structure than does scientific meaning, but that style persists without meaning. In strong contrast to some current views in neuroscience, he believes that the visual perception of spatial textures, which happen also to be linguistic, can be shown to involve precisely the same neuropsychological fundamentals as the visual perception of spatial textures that happen to be random and not linguistic."

Their creations have generally been presented as still images--etchings, drawings, paintings--predecessors to photography. However, the tools and techniques they used, including brushes and blowguns, the irregular cave surfaces and lamps fueled by animal fat, conspired to create works and viewing conditions that made images that appeared to move, changed color, dissolved, cut, appeared and disappeared. In short, they made cinematic images--precursors to film and television."

These structures orchestrate shot selection in real time to create a flowing video experience on-screen. The DMO suggests a new direction for creating cinematic narratives using digital technology. This paper analyzes in detail the first movie produced using the DMO and discusses the process of making interactive movies using the DMO or a similar digital movie-construction kit."

These developments demand a thorough-going ethical practise and a fundamental reformulation of accepted notions of creativity, consciousness and natural and social organization. Outlining key concepts and discoveries in twentieth-century science and philosophy, the author draws attention to the existence of a strong organismic or process tradition in Western culture that is re-emerging in various fields of the physical, biological and social sciences. The author asserts that such a change in science and technology will have global ramifications for humans and that it is the amplification of these insights to which artists should turn their attention."

Specifically, some works of art about art demonstrate that paintings can be construed as propositions. This article describes four works that do so and shows more generally how paintings and prints can be construed as statements when they are considered in the context of art history. The notion that art can make assertions has significant implications for the understanding of the nature of representation and epistemology."

In moments of transformation, stress and difficulty, human beings often react with great creativity. This factor is often underestimated, particularly in the sphere occupied by women. The fact that creativity is the artistic outcome of a process of profound feeling may not be perceived.

These assumptions relate to tensions between views of perception as a matter of data input versus the notion of perception as mental construction. Similarly, there is a tension between the assumption that pictures are meaningful as representations of things and the opposing idea that pictures are meaningful as socially constructed human practices. Aspects of the philosophy of Martin Heidegger are invoked as a means of cutting through these dilemmas. This reading of Heidegger presents truthful representation as a matter of correspondence only when the truth is understood as a means of disclosing a world. The article concludes with practical suggestions for VR research and development appropriated from a Heideggerian perspective."

Under these conditions, paint exhibits a variety of self-similar patterns of increasing complexity, like those found in nature, including growth, flow, erosion and symmetry. Amphiphilic compounds provided the key to creating these self-similar patterns, and time became an element of form, resulting in the creation of representational images characterized by an extraordinary number of spatial scales that, whether viewed from close up or at a distance, were in sharp relief."

These idealized, attractive artificial objects can stand in for information; however, the creators of these images must balance persuasion with accuracy. Some have considered this balancing act a design problem consequent to the scientific process, yet scientists continue to communicate visually to their peers and the public and to incorporate mental models into their work. The author argues that the nature and limitations of visualization are more than a matter of design. Producers and consumers of visualization must also address the interpretive and communicative power of scientific images in society."

This expansion is seen as situated in the universal socialisation of the possession of consumer goods as embodied surrogates for status. Yet, given inevitable eventual constraints on planetary resources, this expansion must one day be attenuated. Existing approaches to ""green"" issues in the field of design concentrate on specific technical matters such as the replacement of precious and limited resources by cheaper, more widely available materials, recycling and the like. The author argues that, while these approaches are important, they are only temporary solutions and in the end it is consumer demand itself that must be abridged. This can only be done by changing the role of consumer imagery, so that its symbolism--currently expressive of the values of a competitive individualism--is diverted into expressions of social solidarity."

Although today new electronic technology could create a web of knowledge around the planet, widespread distribution of information is restrained by patents and copyrights. Technological development thus intensifies the conflict in which the social right to information opposes individual authors' rights to control the dissemination or applicability of new knowledge. The article proposes a critical reevaluation of privately owned information. It suggests a reconsideration of the moral rights of authors to support the emergence of human rights regarding the production and preservation of artificial memory and the ethical and epistemological criticism of science itself.

The author maintains that some of the most potent uses of these technologies conceal hidden agendas and that it is important to expose these agendas in order to render tangible the often invisible ways in which the technologies influence social relations. Given this, much of the article foregrounds what is normally obscured. This is most evident in the article's structure, a computer ""program"" that consists of a FOR/NEXT statement, a DO statement, a GOSUB statement, and BEGIN and END statements [1]. The essay also incorporates statement numbers that function as paragraph numbers. The use of this structure makes conspicuous not only the fact that the experience of written language is highly codified by the binary language of information technologies--that the process of reading a text is now also a process of reading a series of ones and zeros.

Comparison of these theories is presented as an illustration of the similarities between artistic and scientific approaches to creative and cognitive processes. Both Penrose and the artists whose work is discussed here (Charles Beiderman, Hans Hinterreiter and others) have been inspired by projective geometry, the study of the curvature of lines of force and light."

The process is likened to a planning or navigational task and is described through a concept borrowed from the Artificial Intelligence field: the idea of a state space within which a rule-based system operates. The concept of musical state space is postulated and the compositional process described in terms of moves through this space using different planning horizons. The importance of the short-term planning horizon in the creation of an individual style is highlighted, resulting in the definition of a ""creativity corridor."" An individual short-term planning style is thought to be an essential pre-requisite to handling the vast musical state space in a meaningful way.

The author considers the continuing rationale for learning to program, taking into account the visual outcomes related to images generated by programming, looking at some practicing artists who use programming in their work and describing his own Windows-based explorations."

He believes that when the creative potential of the intuitive 3D sketch is fully exploited, architecture can be freed from its traditional constraints. It will become more fluid and complex in appearance and will reach a higher level of performance as a result."

Text written for an interactive medium creates a radically different reading environment. The process of reading hyperfiction is inner-directed rather than other-directed. Since it is the reader who assembles the text, the boundaries between reader and text collapse, and the text is not necessarily perceived as an otherness. According to Baudrillard, the absence of otherness leads to psychodrama, an artificial dramaturgy simulating and dramatizing the absence of the other; in this dramaturgy, the subject becomes interactive, a candidate for all possible connections and combinations. The author addresses questions concerning narrative closure/causality/logic and time raised by the openness to connections and combinations required in navigating through a nonsequential text."

Chaosynth functions by generating a large amount of short sonic events, or particles, in order to form larger, complex sound events. This synthesis technique is inspired by granular synthesis. Most granular synthesis techniques, however, use stochastic methods to control the formation of sound events, while Chaosynth uses a cellular automaton. Following an introduction to the basics of granular synthesis, the author explains how Chaosynth's technique works. He then introduces the basics of cellular automata and presents ChaOs, the cellular automaton used in Chaosynth. The article concludes with some final remarks and suggestions for further work."

The author aims to map a ground for criticism of computer graphics and interactive works--by excavating cultural meanings underlying the dominant aesthetics in these images and asking what they do for their producers and users. Do the metallic bodies armor the user/producer for the fear (delight) of a machine world, producing fear (delight) in the process? Is morphing a technique to evade, or explore, the identity crisis precipitated by awareness of cultural difference? What desires produce and are produced by the gravity-less perspective and movement of three-dimensional animation? The author's theoretical project explores how popular cultural computer aesthetics and techniques express and (re)produce subjectivity in post-modern culture. These ideas are examined through everyday aesthetic experiences, representational practices and techniques, and the accompanying changes in perception."

The author suggests that electronic artists are opening new venues for the use of computers as a human-centered technology by taking into account the complexity of human-machine relationships in a sociocultural perspective. Artistic experiments are giving rise to combinations of the expressive potentials of human natural languages--which extend over aesthetic, metaphoric, artistic, affective and moral domains--and the objective, quantitative and procedural characteristics of computer-related languages. The author proposes that, in a world of social, cultural and economic disparities, the contemporary electronic artist's major struggle must be for balance between uniqueness and uniformity."

There is no longer agreement on a distinction between the natural and the artificial, and contemporary cultural critiques have made references to nature difficult without qualifications. Critiques of nature have also striven to abolish any presence, whether we call it God or the spirit, that exists beyond the frame of a socially constructed discourse. This paper seeks to reinstate spirituality as a category that is associated with a new conception of nature, one that does not reductively resist incursions of technology into what was formerly considered the domain of nature but which preserves a realm of the spirit that is beyond technological manipulation. This new sense of spirituality can address the increasingly complex relations between the natural and the artificial and offers the basis for a new project for designers."

The reason is that, almost by definition, an emergent property defies analysis: if we perform a decomposition of a whole into constituent parts, and we follow this operation by simply adding the parts back together, we will miss any properties that were more than the sum of the parts. The virtual environments that computers (particularly massively parallel ones) allow us to build can become the tools to perform the operation we need here, which is not analysis but synthesis. The discipline of artificial life serves as a good example of this approach, since its ""experiments"" consist in unleashing populations of virtual animals (complete with their own ""DNA"") into a simulated environment, where the emergent traits and behaviors that these populations generate can be studied over many generations."

The foundation for today's synthetic worlds was laid when three-dimensional computer animation first moved into television and film, an era the author labels the ""Chrome Age."" Programmers, in a quest for photographic-quality realism, built the framework for virtual reality--but without artistic training. They overlooked certain aesthetic principles of Renaissance perspective in order to focus on algorithmic techniques, an endeavor that resulted in distinctive plastic-metal textures. Designers, eager to express whatever they could with the new computer-generated look, manipulated the earliest entertainment graphics--show titles and logos--into illusions of precious silver and gold. Due to their symbolic value, chrome logos convinced the public that artificial worlds could eventually become ""real"" and heralded the high-tech entertainment industry--an edifice of science fused with art."

There is no longer a clear conceptual distinction between original and reproduction in virtually any medium. These two states, one pure and original, the other imitative and impure, are now fictions. Images, sounds, and words are received, deconstructed, rearranged, and restored wherever they are seen, heard, and stored. What has happened to the aura surrounding the original work of art, so prized by generations of collectors and critics? Digitalization transfers this aura to the individuated copy. Artist and viewer perform together. The dead replica and the living, authentic original are merging, like lovers entwined in mutual ecstasy."

Siegfried Kracauer's ideas about mass ornament and recent scholarship in film history underlie an examination of the nature of CD-ROMs, leading the author to propose that determinist explanations of technology are not only insupportable but also stand in the way of commercial and artistic development. In the case of CD-ROMs, they also lead to a significant misconceptualization of the medium. The author concludes that any analysis of CD-ROMs depends on which theory of audience and which theory of history are used to conceptualize the medium and proposes that in order to build a catalog of media-specific material and a mass audience for CD-ROMs, outright sales should be replaced with a system of rentals."

Can we construct cultural readings of scientifically derived imagery that are more than just an enigmatic confrontation with seductive visuals? Can we propose an aesthetic or cultural practice that articulates and is informed by scientific knowledge but can function in a wider cultural context? Such a practice, if it existed, we might call a poetics of knowledge."

The author argues that this is a serious omission that debases the expressive and communicative possibilities of interactivity. In the rush to develop the interface that requires a no-effort, no-time learning curve, producers sacrifice the pleasures of connoisseurship and expertise, necessary features for the comprehension and appreciation of art and literature, whether it is ""high"" or ""low,"" serious or playful, mainstream or avant-garde."

Technically, MOOs are a form of computer software and database accessible by multiple users via the Internet. Practically, however, users experience MOOs as a form of shared fiction that they create and inhabit simultaneously. The drama unfolds as text into a unique form of verbal theater with its own rules of structure and unexpected beauty of thought. The critic J.C.C. Mays once referred to the great Irish writer Flann O'Brien's surreal comic fiction as ""a world exhilarating and wrong."" By ""wrong"" he meant not morally wrong but askew, out of kilter with our usual sense of things.

Easy reproduction and faster proliferation of the image mean new ideas are communicated rapidly and each work is considered more briefly by the viewer. Artists' concepts are incorporated into other pieces, with recently exhibited work frequently looked upon as passe. Digitalization produces intangible art, planned rather than crafted by the artist. The temporality, intangibility, and transience that mark art's ephemeralness are advanced through cyberspace, where the digital piece is placed on a network, downloaded, manipulated, and placed back on the network by others, sometimes simultaneously. Someday the artist may manipulate a program she or he began long ago without recognizing the creator or the creation.

Three schematic phases are distinguishable in the short history of Brazilian video. In the 1970s it was explored exclusively by artists in search of new means and foundations for their creative ideas. In the 1980s independent video appeared, enlarging the range of creative video and bringing it to a wider public. In the 1990s a new wave of videomakers pursues more mature and individual work, while at the same time seeking to fortify previous achievements."

What the artist says and the way it is said are one and the same thing. The art historian seeks not only to describe the form, meaning and development of material culture, but also to relate human artifacts to the thoughts, feelings and conditions that produce them. The author compares art history to the disciplines of art and science, offering five principles that define the discipline as a ""natural science of the spirit."""

While it revolutionized art history, the use of photography tended to lift large works out of context, aggrandize details through cropping and sacrifice a sense of scale by showing works in isolation. The author explains that new uses of computer technology are moving beyond these limitations. Along with a team of specialists, she is creating software for constructing three-dimensional, digital representations of works of art that provide continuous, mobile views, as though the spectator were walking through the work's environment or floating through its space at a natural speed. The author discusses her initial projects with the software and its potential uses in art-historical research and education."

One of the most characteristic features of Western science is the formulation of laws of nature, which lead to a deterministic description in which future and past play the same role. However, these characteristics, especially time reversibility, contradict everything we see around us. Everywhere we see the arrow of time. The recent developments in non-equilibrium physics and in the dynamics of unstable systems lead to a new concept of laws of nature no more associated with ""certitudes"" as with ""probabilities."" This formulation includes the arrow of time and describes an open, evolutionary universe, over-coming the Cartesian duality that puts Humans outside Nature."

Today, each new advance in computer technology has facilitated the appropriation and transformation of a work or idea into new creations.

It calls attention to the diversity of views technological artists may hold about futurity, newness and bodies, and suggests that popular fascination with the ""newest and latest"" need not divert artists from investigating alternatives to dominant Western techno-logics."

Their artistic production ranges from films and expanded projections challenging cinematic norms, to immersive visual and auditive environments. Their interest in a range of diverse technologies--mechanical, chemical, electronic, digital--raises issues of interdisciplinarity and mobility within the various technological potentials available to artists today."

For example, in the Liar Paradox, the assumption that ""This statement is false"" is either true or false leads to the conclusion that it is both true and false. Depictions of so-called ""impossible objects"" in the late works of M. C. Escher are visually paradoxical. There are deep similarities between visual and logico-semantic paradoxes. In the case of the visual paradoxes, knowledge of various means of representing distance enables us to explain how the paradoxical effect is achieved. A novel approach to solving the Liar and other logico-semantic paradoxes consists of coming to understand how the impossibility of their conclusions arises by means analogous to those by which visually impossible objects are produced."

This is true not only because of limitations in display and processing power in graphics computers currently available, but also because few people create virtual worlds in the context of artistic expression. Key to providing intriguing and engaging worlds is an understanding of the power of emotional content. The authors propose that an emotive response can be elicited in a subject through strategic use of imagery and sound in a virtual environment, which will enhance the sensation of immersion in the simulation and thereby help to compensate for the inadequacies of contemporary technology. Their artwork, ""Virtopia"", draws on psychology in its implementation of virtual-reality technologies to produce aurally and visually immersive environments that engage the participant on an emotional level."

The first artwork that tried to realistically depict interplanetary space and the surfaces of other planets did not appear until the publication of Jules Verne's classic novels. The subsequent burgeoning of both astronomical knowledge and the new literary genre of science fiction increased the need for artists specializing in realistic depictions of outer space, other planets and spacecraft. Space art proved to be a major influence on the public's perception of the universe as well as on the development of space exploration. Today's space artist is considered by astronomers and space scientists to be a valued colleague."

It can be understood as a unifying element within Islamic culture. On another level, the connection between music and astronomy is direct, with astronomical concepts directly applied to music and some musical concepts applied to astronomy.

Archaeological excavators and visual artists are involved in a process of image formation. They not only document and replicate the appearance of things, but also make ideas, concepts and experiences visible. The Gestalt principles of similarity, proximity, continuity and closure provide a way to understand how the mind orders and groups the complex visual relationships that are created and observed in a given field or environment. Gestalt research into figure-ground relationships finds correspondence in the archaeological concept of object-context. These ideas find a philosophical correspondence in the imagery and teachings of Taoism. Together they offer an interdisciplinary way to think about the shapes, patterns and structure of time and change."

With the introduction of motion pictures, the elements of time and action allowed for further manipulation of images. Now, the advent of digital photography has further blurred the distinction between factual reality and expressive reality, increasing distrust in the reliability of images."

Although she opened up space for a rather tantalizing dialogue in this area, it is to non-Western cultures that one should look for narrative structures that fit the sophistication of Western new technologies. The theories and processes of African oral literature provide the groundwork for such a narrative model. A comparison of contemporary postmodern thought and African oral literature shows that they share many attributes. Through a description of her work, which challenges the notion of book arts and narrative theory, as well as through an exploration of the advanced mathematical theory of fuzzy logic, the author opens the door for a discussion of narrative that crosses cultural, aesthetic, and academic boundaries.

If we are ever to make sense of the problems posed by the new media and the opportunities these offer, we must begin to rethink our longstanding equation of meaning with the logic and syntactical structures of language and reevaluate our other ways of knowing the world."

""Ornitorrinco in Eden"" and ""Rara Avis"", two recent examples of worldwide networked telepresence installations presented publicly over the Internet, are discussed in the paper. A framework is presented to introduce theoretical and cultural aspects of this work. It is proposed that the use of electronic media in art to physically act on remote spaces constitutes a new aesthetic element, compared to the more traditional representational use of such media. It is also proposed that a new aesthetic is emerging out of artistic experimentation with operation of telerobots, co-existence in virtual and real spaces, synchronicity of actions, real-time remote control, man-animal-plant-robot interfaces, and collaboration through networks. In a technical appendix, Ed Bennett describes the design and implementation of the hardware and software used in ""Ornitorrinco in Eden"" and ""Rara Avis."" This is followed by a glossary defining the main technical terminology of telepresence systems."

It may be viewed as the computer-age equivalent of minimal art. Its goals are based on concepts from algorithmic information theory. A low-complexity artwork can be specified by a computer algorithm and should comply with two properties: (1) the drawing should ""look right,"" and (2) the Kolmogorov complexity of the drawing should be small (the algorithm should be short) and a typical observer should be able to see this. Examples of low-complexity art are given in the form of algorithmically simple cartoons of various objects. Attempts are made to relate the formalism of the theory of minimum description length to informal notions such as ""good artistic style"" and ""beauty."""

As an embodiment of our understanding of the mind, the classical art of mnemonics developed an architectonics of memory based on the idea of mental places, or loci, in which things could be stored. This is now known as the method of loci, a technique still found effective by contemporary psychologists. Further study of mnemonic theory--including constructs of modern art theory, philosophy and cognitive psychology, along with ideas developed by classical orators--suggests that mental organization structures itself in a fundamentally spatial manner. This common spatiality links mental functioning and architecture, and allows architecture to persuasively engage and influence the human mind."

These commentators follow a well-established literary and iconographic tradition that uses the language of empire and autocratic rule to describe the dominance of these carnivores over the rest of the natural world. The author analyzes the development of this paradigm of dominance from its inception to its latest articulations. In the author's opinion, the savage view of prehistoric nature has its roots in the philosophy of the Social Darwinists and their dreams of imperial rule over the non-Western societies they considered racially inferior. The paradigm of dominance today legitimizes violence and conquest under the guise of a scientific view of the savagery of prehistoric nature."

On the basis of an analysis of relations between the signified and the signifier in iconic artistic signs, the author shows that an iconic artistic sign has two fundamental levels of meaning: referential and formal. The first focuses attention on the signified object; the second, on the inventiveness and morphological complexity of its sign articulation. The first level is automatically accessible through spontaneous visual experience, while the second level can only be activated by metapictorial (artistic) competence, which is defined by the author as the ability to recognize the creative formative aspects of a sign form and their structural correlations."

In particular, both relied on the information-processing metaphor of mind. This interaction is represented in a computer program called ROSE (Representation of Spatial Experience), which produces childlike drawings. That the information-processing metaphor did not easily accommodate development was subsequently over-looked by drawing research. Al researchers moved on to study dynamic systems that actually do develop. Here, a computer program implementation, EOR, is proposed that is intended to represent a potentially fruitful interaction between the study of children's drawing development and modern Al theory."

An example of such a creative leap occurred during a recorded study of the activity of a small design team. Several different analyses of the recorded design activity made by independent researchers confirm the critical role of this creative leap in the design process of the team. The author reviews some generic descriptive models of creative design for insight into the design team study and discusses issues for the computational modeling of creative design based on these observations. It is suggested that creative insight in design should be regarded as a perceptual bridge-building between problem and solution, rather than a leap."

Insofar as people interact with them, computer systems function primarily as sensual transducers. The author posits that computer-based multimedia should be considered ""synaesthetic media"" due to their capacity to translate between modes of sensory perception. Synaesthetic media are the result of focusing design efforts on the perceptual possibilities of human-computer interaction (HCI). The author claims that such computer tools can serve as powerful supporters of human creativity. Rather than expending more effort on the fruitless quest for cognitive artifacts, he states, we need to recognize that we are already creating synaesthetic media and to direct our HCI design efforts accordingly."

The goal of this paper is to stimulate inquiry into both surveillance and the rhetoric used to justify its use. ""Reflectionism"" is proposed as a new philosophical and tactical framework that takes the Situationist tradition of appropriating the methodology of the oppressor one step further by targeting that methodology directly against the oppressor.

Thus, it is possible to define the geometric structure of what I refer to here as the Albertian model.

The author looks at three artistic groupings--Wassily Kandinsky and the Bauhaus school, the Abstract Expressionists and the contemporary electronic arts--and traces the influences of various spiritual movements on them. The author then turns to the spiritual in modern science, observing that quantum theory has been the main starting point for many physicists to write about religious ideas. Several issues are examined: whether science at this juncture is more receptive to the spiritual than are the arts; whether art can mediate between science and the spiritual; and whether the spiritual is antecedent to both the arts and science."

In the twentieth century, many new imaging techniques have made intracellular structures more and more visible. The author examines several images of the cell drawn from scientific sources, to illustrate how the biologist's view of the cell has changed over time and how these images, like works of art, have aesthetic qualities. Many twentieth-century artists, beginning with the surrealists, have also used cellular forms in their work. Wassily Kandinsky is one artist for whom there is particularly good documentation relating to the influence of scientific cell images on his work. Diego Rivera painted realistic cells in several of his murals. The abstract expressionists were also interested in cellular forms, and this interest continues in the work of several contemporary artists. In this survey, images of the cell from art and science are found to complement each other and to enrich our understanding of the basic unit of life."

However, the most readily available convex lenses available in the seventeenth century were those used for spectacles; these lenses had diameters of about 4 cm. The author shows that the use of such lenses in a large-scale camera obscura results in images of interior scenes that are too dim for effective visual inspection. Problems of inversion, reversal and depth of focus further complicate the images. It is concluded that Vermeer could not have traced his interiors directly at full size from the screen of a camera obscura. Vermeer's composition and approach to linear perspective could have been stimulated by use of a small camera obscura, but his final works must have been painted right-side up and in good light."

Moreover, cycles in different kinds of art appear to coincide. The data obtained is useful not only for studies of the evolution of art, but also for forecasting future creative cycles."

Surprisingly, the two sectors most concerned with building this space have been artists and the telecommunications industry. Finding a way to increase collaboration between the two would accelerate the development of the network.

Several challenges face their creators. Since a large portion of the computational resources in interactive works is devoted to graphics, where and how do we locate the computing power required to drive artificial intelligence? As autonomous action competes with displayed behavior for processor clock cycles, what can one do to graphics to make them both more efficient and more expressive? One solution is to prerender imagery and find better ways to manage it. Another challenge one faces in acquiring the ability to give birth to interesting creatures is finding a suitable tool box. We need to develop intuitive interfaces that make it possible for designers to craft individual personalities without the need to resort to programming.

Digital imaging, for example, has produced special effects and animations that were unimaginable before computer technology, and audiences are attracted to intellectually empty blockbuster films to experience the thrilling spectacle of new technology. Moreover, the organization of the industry from camera control to box office has also been transformed by computer control systems. The author proceeds from an acknowledgment of the way technological change has altered films and the structure of the industry but argues that there is also a relationship between the way that mainstream cinema organizes its narratives and the methods of science and technology. As our understanding of these changes, so does the internal logic of cause and effect in stories that we see. However, the author uses a nondeterminist historical approach to show the complexity of this interaction, and especially to emphasize that it is not simply a one-way traffic. On the contrary, the extent to which science, technology, and entertainment track the same trajectory throughout the century is apparent in the ways scientists have approached the problem of artificial intelligence. The paper concludes by posing this question: If digital technology is changing culture, why is it that its closest cousins--radio and television--are creatively less responsive to it than its antique ancestor--the cinema?"

In attempting to define the idea and the reality of the cyborg, the author focuses upon contemporary cultural expressions of cyborg consciousness and their ""applications"" in contemporary television and cinema. He examines the work of theorists--Donna Haraway, Joseba Gabilondo, and others--that draws on rich cross-currents between the arts and science as much as it responds to trends in popular culture. Throughout the expanding literature on postmodernity, ""cyborg culture"" mirrors discourse in advanced disciplines and technologies, as well as activity in the most pedestrian aspects of popular culture. With the advent of computer animation, and its drive to achieve absolute realism, cyborg imagery has helped define the new computer-generated visual landscapes that have forever changed the face of film and television."

The author explores emergence, briefly tracing the history of debate around the term before using the work of Peter Cariani to discuss the problems involved in describing the results of computational processes as emergent. The relevance of these points to a-life art is illustrated through an imaginary software project in the form of an a-life ""breeder."" Finally, the urge for emergence is considered in its most general sense as a desire that leads outside art and human design, one that might paradoxically be fulfilled by cultural and social systems themselves, rather than by the artifacts they produce."

The author suggests that it can also shed light on ""life as we know it."" A complex series of decisions and presumptions precedes the selection of a given artificial entity as lifelike. For the artist, the processes of selection and representation bring into question what has been characterized by sculptor Michael Grey as ""the relationship between ontology and ontogeny,"" or the interconnectedness of being and its formal embodiment. The work of biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela suggest that these two aspects of life are inseparable components of autopoiesis and are, moreover, environmentally determined and determining. If this is the case, then artificial life is not just a product of research but is structurally coupled with other natural and artificial life forms as part of a dynamic autopoietic system."

A-life is proposed here as a place to locate art practice for artists who are interested in technoscience, and who are concerned with the ""two cultures"" gap between the humanities and the sciences. Mythical narratives that underpin new computational techniques, such as the dream of transformation or even generation of life, are not dismissed but become the impetus for resituating a-life as a set of representational strategies with great creative potential. A-life is linked to a particular aspect of 20th century art: how artists have developed and expressed the conviction that art and everyday life are inextricably enmeshed."

He proposes an alternative to the use of pictures to communicate, drawing on semiotic distinctions. With the author's approach, iconic representations--in which the sign bears a physical similarity to that which it represents--are shown directly, rather than in a format that must be reconstructed or decoded. This method of communication is illustrated with messages based on quantum-mechanical phenomena. The advantages of having the content of a message reflected in the form of the message are detailed."

Although Duchamp talked of ""Playful Physics"" in his notes for the Glass, much of his humor and the breadth of his creative invention was obscured for later audiences when, after 1919, the popularization of relativity theory eclipsed the late Victorian ether physics that had fascinated the public in the early years of the century. Indeed, drawing upon contemporary science and technology, among other fields, Duchamp had created in the ""Large Glass"" a witty, multivalent commentary on the age-old theme of sexual desire, presented in the very newest verbal and visual languages. These ideas are explored in this article, reprinted from the conclusion of the author's book ""Duchamp in Context: Science and Technology in the"" Large Glass and Related Works."""

As computer programs, they reflect the complex nature of music ontology and must support real-time manipulation of multimedia data. In addition, these programs must be usable by native users, supporting their creative process without obstructing it through technical difficulties. To achieve these goals, the authors argue, CMEs must be provided with a well-defined methodology relying on techniques from the fields of software engineering, artificial intelligence, and knowledge representation. This paper contributes an aspect of this methodology, concentrating on the role of visualizations in CMEs. The authors state that visualization deserves a specialized theory that is based on music ontology and that is independent of the concrete, implemented graphical interface."

Virtual reality (VR) now offers artists a soft medium for creating artificial experiences of space, time and energy through mathematical models. In this article the author outlines his artistic explorations leading to the creation of ""Alembic,"" an alchemical VR installation that challenges the representational simulation of reality often associated with the medium of VR."

The aim of EVEDs is to place the participant in a slightly altered visual reality in order to cause him or her to see real things anew. The article describes several works of participation art that can be seen as historical precedents to EVEDs. The author discusses two EVEDs that he invented: Whirld is a cylindrical room mounted on an axle that functions as a spinning camera obscura; Portable Whirld is a hood that functions as a portable camera obscura. The author describes how the two sculptures reshape the spectator's visual perceptions, and suggests some forms that future EVEDs might take."

In this article, the author begins by summarizing this history, pointing to the inadequacy of most theoretical accounts in the face of the growing interpenetration of the ""natural"" by the ""technological"" resulting from such developments as genetic engineering and artificial intelligence. The author goes on to argue that the convergence between scientific developments in the field of artificial life and the emergent art movement points to the development of a new understanding of this relationship and a new role for the artist."

He explains fundamental growth types as the kinetic aspects of a class of structurally coupled autonomous systems. Two paradigms are treated with examples: the settling of clans competing for space and the concurrent sprouting of up to three plants. The author uses and explains his method of morphography, which generally requires of the artistically inclined scientist the design and usage of computer-generated figures called morphograms."

This false distinction is founded on another ill-founded one between private states of mind and public languages. Echoing works by R. de Sousa, we can talk about the rationality of emotions. Following N. Goodman and I. Scheffler, we are conducted to the notion of cognitive emotions. If there are aesthetic emotions, they are likely cognitive. The notion of supervenience seems very adequate to show how aesthetic emotion, even aesthetic pleasure, can be related to cognitive experience."

After introducing the main concepts of a theory of the artificial, the author extends the theory to communication and the arts, both of which provide compelling examples of the generation of artificial objects or processes. The author conceives of art as a paradoxical communication process by which transfiguration does not represent a failure of the reproduction process but, rather, the true objective of the artist."

We are at an important crossroads in defining intellectual property rights that will have a direct impact on the way we create and disseminate electronic art in the future.

The Impermanence Agent--a programmatic, esthetic, and critical project created by the author, Brion Moss, a.c. chapman, and Duane Whitehurst--operates differently. It begins as a storytelling agent, telling stories of impermanence, stories of preservation, memorial stories. It monitors each user's Web browsing, and starts customizing its storytelling by weaving in images and texts that the user has pulled from the Web. In time, the original stories are lost. New stories, collaboratively created, have taken their place."

It begins with a consideration of the dramatizations of an on-line improvisational group known as the Plaintext Players. Life and Death are discussed as contestants in a great morality play; as psychological driving force in the performances; as formal textual realm; and as thematic setting. The article goes on to discuss the complex negotiations of subject and object in the intricate interactions of dialogue, action, and spoofing in MOO performances. Finally the author considers ""Real Life as Afterlife,"" as one of the Players' performances is transposed onto the real-life stage."

It can involve an area of ritual action, a private, artificial paradise, or a public sphere with politically suggestive power--in short, it encompasses a visual history that is characterized by totality. The concept of transposing viewers into an enclosed, illusionary visual space has been revived and expanded in the VR art of the current age. The more intimately an interface nestles into viewers' senses, the more intense their immersion will be. Such an interface weakens the viewers' sense of psychological distance and puts the relationship between art and consciousness into question."

In designing and playing lumia, three principal dimensions require attention: color, form, and motion. By organizing the design of lumia and instruments for creating them along these dimensions, it is possible to learn a great deal from art theory and history, as guidelines have been devised for the effective use of each of these dimensions."

In this paper, the proper dynamic of materiality is explored by looking in particular at what it means to be in a permanent touch with the world with the body. Against this background, efforts at denying or transforming the body in the context of new technologies can be interpreted as the wish to control or avoid the unpredictable and unconscious dimensions of human existence."

Even when invoked by those with a vested interest in art, the potential ascribed to art within this economy does not do justice to the range and critical power of art. Transgressing this art-science binary, the author explores how objectivity is practiced within art and argues that the relationship between art and science is not a matter of boundaries but of intertwined inflections of understanding."

Chroma or chromatic intensity is presented as the key to understanding the language of color theory. This is supported by the first images ever of azurite cut by a focused ion beam (FIB) in order to compare unprepared and prepared particles of the mineral and thus demonstrate the importance of the preparation process. The implications of a natural pigment renaissance for artists and restorers are assessed."

This, in turn, prompted the author to learn more about encaustic from an industrial-hygiene perspective. Owing to the commendable handling characteristics of encaustic, many painters after using it never go back to using oil or acrylic paints; however, the act of heating wax creates airborne substances that can cause long-term health effects to artists who do not take common-sense precautions. This article offers information to help artists set up safer encaustic/conventional painting studios. The author also introduces encaustic's long history, describes various encaustic techniques and lists permanent pigments that are generally safer than other professionally accepted materials."

The idea of Turrell's pieces as ""pure chromatic sensations"" is implausible to perceptual psychologists who have adopted the ecological approach of J. J. Gibson. Such psychologists view visual sensations as mere symptoms of the stimulation of the photoreceptors in our retinae. Their idea goes against the traditional theory of color. The tendency of philosophers throughout history has been to take colors to be the exemplary instances of simple, unanalyzable qualities. However, the difficulties of proving that these qualities can be traced back to a set of material properties suggest that there is no coherent view on their ontological status. The author considers current efforts to address this problem, along with the relevance of these attempts to criticism of Turrell's artworks."

Hausmann articulated a new, ""televisual"" form of presence, which also implied a new form of tele-tactility. As his notion of tactility returns in Paik's work, the Optophon might be construed as the historical origin of the genre called ""video art."" Yet, it could be argued that Hausmann's technological reasoning produced an interruption at the very site where such art-historical legacies are constituted."

The required method of this exploration is interactive computer music systems. Some examples are discussed bearing on the author's compositional experience with his ""Sound & Fury"" project.

In this work, iconic elements are the basic building blocks of a world literally made of language. This world has the capacity to evolve, change and mutate through human interaction and its own evolutionary process. Communication with the resident life forms occurs via the iconic language that defines the world, including its elements, forms, entities, spaces and behaviors."

However, the level of activation appeared lower in the expert than in the novice, suggesting that a skilled artist may process facila information more efficiently.

His eye fixations when painting or drawing were of twice the duration of those when he was not painting and also quite different from those of novice artists. His eye-hand co-ordination pattern also showed differences from that of novices, being more temporally consistent. This preliminary work suggest that detailed and quantitative analysis of a working artist is feasible and will illuminate the process of artistic creation."

However, since their expertise lies in science, they each speak from a principally scientific point of view. In fact, a common ground that emerges among them is an overt interest in point of view, which takes the form of examining the modeler's investment in and engagement with the model. Each speaker finds some potential there, rather than limitations. Since artists tend to project their subjectivity explicitly into their work and also to be aware of how the forms or media they use influence the representations they make, the interviewees' approaches to modeling do offer points of connection between art and science."

One of the leading scholars of the subject was Henri Poincaré, who was also a widely read theorist of the scientific discovery process, keenly concerned with the role of the intuition and the subconscious. His writings, and those of his interpreters, could well have increased the appeal of four-dimensional geometry for artists already attracted to the possibilities presented by these concepts. The working notes of one such artist, Marcel Duchamp, record directly his debt to ideas linked to Poincaré--an example of the interaction of greatly different parts of the wider culture."

The relationship between digital images and their encoded files, and in other cases, between digital images and the algorithms that generate them as display, lends itself to a conviction that the image and the file are mutually interchangeable. This relationship posits a connection of identicality between the file and the image according to which the mathematical basis and the image seem to share similar claims to truth. Since the history of images within Western culture is fraught with charges of deception and illusion, the question arises whether the ontological condition of the digital image, its very existence and identity, challenges this tradition. Or, by contrast, does the material instantiation of images, in their display or output, challenge the truth claims of the mathematically based digital file?"

Taken as a discursive practice, science fiction constructs futurological narratives of progress as well as conditions the very techniques and research that may have taken place. The tensions and inconsistencies within the biotech industry are considered as a zone where science fiction is put to work as negotiator and mode of legitimization. However, as cultural theorists such as Fredric Jameson and Jean Baudrillard suggest, science fiction can also fulfill a critical function, highlighting the contingencies and limitations in biotech's self-fulfilling narrative of future-medicine. A consideration of the emerging category of ""net.art"" provides one starting point for a critical science fiction practice."

However, when one views pictorial art, these binocular and monocular cues are discordant, and thus a perceptual ""cue conflict"" arises. This acts to reduce the relative apparent perceived distance of objects in a painting, thus producing overall perceptual depth ""flattening."" The theory and physiology underlying this phenomenon are discussed."

Current trends in computer animation have made successful and effective teamwork a necessity. To address these issues, the authors have developed an interdisciplinary computer animation course for artists and scientists, in which student teams produce a professional animation that extends the capabilities of a commercial animation package. A key component of this course is the use of collaborative teams that provide practical experience and cross-mixing of student expertise. Another key component is group-based education: the students learn from each other, as well as from the instructors."

IVR presents surprisingly difficult interface challenges, and the study of interface and interaction design for educational IVR use is just beginning. In this paper, the authors discuss three issues encountered in the creation of an IVR-based educational project: the use of architectural spaces for structuring a sequence of modules, the trade-offs between metaphorical fidelity and convenience, and the use of IVR in interaction with visualizations of abstract concepts."

Subsequently, trying to understand the fundamental forms in nature, she discovered a continuity underlying them: Spirals are not only forms of growth or turbulence, but are also the link between spheres (forms of balance and minimum volume/energy) and waves (forms of energy/motion). Flow phenomena shaped the new style of her landscape sculptures, which are expressions of fluid dynamics and other nonlinear processes."

Through codification systems using musical language, it is possible to understand the patterns that the global dynamics of cellular automata produce and to use the results in the musical domain. In the authors' approach, music can be considered the semantics of complexity. The authors identify analogies between elements of cellular automata and elements of musical form, creating a narrative musical framework that has allowed them to develop a productive, computational and semantic methodology. Music fosters an increased capability for analyzing and reconstructing complexity, providing unexpected insight into its organization."

Using this method, 240 paintings by three famous Russian artists (Pavel Kuznetsov, Constantin Korovin and Ilya Mashkov) were studied. Both the common features and the individual peculiarities of their creativity are revealed, including the ""integral stability"" of each artist's creative process and its changes over time."

In 1999 the authors identified the patterns as fractal. Ending 50 years of debate over the content of his paintings, the results raised the more general question of how a human being could create fractals. The authors, by analyzing film that recorded the evolution of Pollock's patterns as a function of time, show that the fractals resulted from a systematic construction process involving multiple layers of painted patterns. These results are interpreted within the context of recent visual perception studies of fractal patterns."

It takes into consideration historic forebears, particularly the ancient Greek art of memory, contemporary theorists, and current new media artists who are pushing code and application design to new limits. The essay specifically addresses the role of the artist as ""coder"" and application engineer and anticipates concerns and possible technological developments in data visualization and virtual spaces. As new media artists write their own code, current boundaries between disciplines and sectors become blurred and new aesthetic judgments become pivotal. Additionally, current management and organizational structures are challenged to confront a world that increasingly visualizes and communicates in 3D."

These concepts are general--not specific to any culture or technology. In the accom-panying arguments, the author expands on these concepts, illustrating them with examples taken from conventional and electronic media, space and cyberspace. With these conjectures, the author hopes to begin a discussion on the anthropology of space and its emulation."

The desire to exist in an anti-mechanistic state of expansion is temporarily and symbolically realized in engaging immersive art. In virtual immersion, conventional optic models may be surpassed."

OULIPO, also known as Ouvroir de Litérature Potentielle, is a literary and artistic association founded in the 1960s whose combinatoric methods and experimental concepts continue to be generative and relevant to this day. Recombinant Poetics is a term that I coined in 1995 in order to define a particular approach to emergent meaning that is used in generative virtual environments and other computer-based combinatoric media forms. Combinatoric works enable the exploration of sets of media elements in different orders and combinations. The meaning of such work is derived through dynamic interaction. Another group exploring combinatorics uses digital audio techniques.

In a widespread cognitive environment, diachronic and spatial communication values have to be adapted. The development of linguistic flows, codified according to digital models, leads net users to interact in a different way. In a decentralized environment, many conditions for composing and listening to music may be subordinated to the conception of creative thought as a combination of recursive, connective, and systemic processes, which redefine not only the concept of musical object and sound space, but also that of music itself."

The essay posits that techno-industrial culture and the production of technological art have been superimposed to the point where artists are often indistinguishable from commercial entities trying to sell the next hype-laden device. This is also true in the case of intangible on-line art, as market and institutional forces rematerialize net and other forms of screen-based art. The combination of hype and the temporal constraints of development and production result in a milieu where professed claims seldom live up to the final product. The cycle of promotion of the 'Next Big Thing,' whether art, data, or consumer object, outstrips any possibility for finished products to keep pace with expectations raised by the 'Alpha' and 'Beta' pre-release stages. The result is an inordinate degree of media attention focused on ideas that are barely out of conceptual stages or 'Alpha Revision,' so that conceptual artists of the informational milieu must become engaged in the high-speed production of concept proposals, or 'Alpha Revisionist' works."

In the 1920s, his ""Lumia"" compositions were praised by art critics and performed throughout the U.S. After initially embracing a musical analogy to explain Lumia, in the early 1930s he shifted to an analogy based on painting. In pursuit of this new context, Wilfred sought to legitimize Lumia through a relationship with the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His career is emblematic of the difficulties inherent in the creation of art using technology early in the 20th century, years before the postmodern embrace of pluralism."

If we distinguish the ""form"" of sound from its ""matter,"" the discussion can then be divided into two parts. First, how can sound forms (shapes, profiles) suggest other temporal forms, such as movement? The hypothesis developed here is that senscrimotor experience is generalized to furnish a base, in successive layers, for identifying suggested movements that are more and more abstract. Secondly, how can a sound be said to be ""hot"" or ""cold,"" ""dark"" or ""clear""? Metaphors concerning the matter of sound deal with a common level of synesthesia; a few stages of the historical study of this phenomenon are recalled here."

In its pathological context, synesthesia is described as a confusion of the senses where the excitation of one sense triggers stimulation in a completely different sensory modality. In contrast to this pathological form, synesthesia can also be considered as a physiological behavior that involves a multimodal combination of all senses. Such an expression of sensory perception can also be considered as a natural process that contributes to the adaptation of the living organism to its environment. The author attempts to analyze the cerebral mechanisms involved in sensory perception and synesthesia."

It holds, however, an enormous aesthetic potential. The author first reviews the theoretical and technical background of polarization microscopy and then discusses how selected microscopic structures imaged via polarization microscopy can be represented according to the artist's individual aesthetic choices, the most important of which is color design by interference. The conscious perception of the pictures by the observer is discussed on the basis of our present knowledge of cognitive neurosciences. Polarization microscopy leads to a crossing of the boundaries between nature and the forms of non-representational painting."

They introduce a specialized computer language, called HyperFun, that facilitates the modeling of complex objects. In addition to presenting computer-generated textured and animated models of pre-existing sculptures, they also show how novel shapes can be generated using the HyperFun system. Finally they outline two advanced projects concerned with creating a sculpture-based augmented reality that allows for the interactive participation of the observer."

One technique takes experiments on interlimb coordination from the laboratory to the dance studio. Another technique, termed fixed-point technique, makes use of the fact that one can change which part of the body is fixed in space. A third technique is based on the idea that one can maintain the action, as it were, by ""reversing the acting limb."" All techniques target a specific capacity of the motor system and as such may inspire new psychophysical experiments. The present approach to generating movements, which merges dance improvisation with insights from cognitive neuroscience and biokinesiology, may also be fruitfully extended to robotics."

On the one hand, the population of the Web and our PCs with characters who reflect us can be seen as a humanization of a previously purely mechanical interface. On the other hand, the mechanization of subjectivity carries the danger of simply reducing the human to the machine. The author argues that predominant artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to modeling agents are based on an erasure of subjectivity analogous to that which appears when people are subjected to institutionalization. The result is agent behavior that is fragmented, depersonalized, lifeless and incomprehensible. Approaching the problem using a hybrid of critical theory and AI agent technology, the author argues that agent behavior should be narratively understandable; she presents a new agent architecture that structures behavior to be comprehensible as narrative."

This essay reexamines the interrelationship of these tendencies as they developed in the 1960s, focusing on the art criticism of Jack Burnham and the artists included in the ""Software"" exhibition that he curated. The historicization of these practices as distinct artistic categories is examined. By interpreting conceptual art and art-and-technology as reflections and constituents of broad cultural transformations during the information age, the author concludes that the two tendencies share important similarities, and that this common ground offers useful insights into late-20th-century art."

They use Peter Cariani's taxonomy of adaptive robotic systems as a framework for comparing the capabilities of systems that interact with their environments. The authors then describe two examples of structurally autonomous systems that are able to construct their own sensors independently of a human designer. The first device, the evolved radio, is the result of a recent hardware evolution (HE) experiment conducted by the authors. The second device, the electrochemical ear, was constructed almost 50 years ago by the British cybernetician Gordon Pask. The emergent behavior in both systems is only possible because many conventional engineering constraints were relaxed during their construction. Using existing technology, artists have the opportunity to explore the potential of structurally autonomous systems as interactive artworks."

These automatic designs are inspired by nature and achieved through an artificial coevolutionary process to adapt the bodies and brains of artificial life-forms simultaneously through interaction with a simulated reality. Through the use of rapid manufacturing, these evolved designs can be transferred from virtual to true reality. The artificial evolution process embedded in realistic physical simulation can create simple designs often recognizable from the history of biology or engineering. This paper provides a brief review of three generations of these robots, from automatically designed LEGO structures, through the GOLEM project of electromechanical systems based on ""truss"" structures, to new modular designs that make use of a generative, DNA-like representation."

Taccola was well known in Siena, and his drawings were studied and copied by artists of the period, probably serving as models for Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks. However, his work has received little attention from scholars and students in recent times. The author, a sculptor, has long been interested in Taccola's drawings for his studio projects. Although Taccola lacked the fine drawing hand displayed by many of his contemporaries, his inventive work may appeal especially to viewers today. Based on examination of the original drawings, the author discusses the qualities that make Taccola's drawings unique and considers what Taccola's intentions may have been in making them."

Particular emphasis is placed on the connection between the conjectural solutions of this discrete geometrical problem and the fruit arrangements in the receptacles of lotuses, because in most cases the actual fruit arrangements are identical to the mathematical solutions. As the lotus is an important symbol in Buddhism and lotus decorations are quite common in Japanese Buddhist art, packings of circles in a circle have been represented in Japanese art for centuries."

Presented 35 years ago and still paradigmatic for the ever-shifting boundaries between art, technology, commerce and entertainment, Cybernetic Serendipity epitomizes some of the complicated dynamics that delineate the gamut of media art today."

Similar works can be obtained by simulating fluid flows on a computer, using the Navier-Stokes equations as the physical model of the fluid flows. The author has created an application program that includes marbling tools. Such a program must run in real time, so that hand-eye coordination is required of the user. Real-time simulation of fluid flows requires much processor power. The author has attempted to adapt this technique for use with a personal computer. To decrease the processing power required, the image size may be decreased, but the results may not be as satisfactory."

Dyer","Leonardo",37,"1",2004-01-01,"pp. 53-56","10.2307/1577574","The MIT Press","fla","","The similarity in fractal dimensions of paint ""blobs"" in samples of gestural expressionist art implies that these pigment strctures are statistically indistinguishable from one another. This conclusion suggests that such dimensions cannot be used as a ""finger-print"" for identifying the work of a single artist. To overcome this limitation, the authors have adopted the multifractal spectrum as an alternative tool for artwork analysis. For the pigment blobs, it is demonstrated that this spectrum can be used to isolate a construction paradigm or art style. Additionally, the fractal dimensions of edge structures created by luminance gradients on the canvas are analyzed, yielding a potential method for visual discrimination of fractally similar paintings."
"10.2307/1577575","A Symphony of Sensations in the Spectator: Le Corbusier's ""Poème électronique"" and the Historicization of New Media Arts","Katie Mondloch","Leonardo",37,"1",2004-01-01,"pp. 57-61","10.2307/1577575","The MIT Press","fla","","This essay seeks to historicize the technological production of artistic virtual space, which is often misconstrued as having originated with contemporary new media art production. The author critically investigates Le Corbusier's ""Poème électronique,"" a 1958 automated multimedia performance commissioned by the Philips Corporation for its pavilion at the World's Fair in Belgium, as a paradigmatic example of much earlier attempts to create a spatialized, virtual experience in the spectator. The author argues that the highly disciplined spectatorship conditions of the ""Poème électronique"" have many suggestive parallels with those of contemporary artistic production in new media, thus offering a theoretical and historical foundation for art-historical discourse regarding the proliferation of immersive multimedia artworks in contemporary practice."
"10.2307/1577576","A Universal Grammar for Visual Composition?","Peter D. Stebbing","Leonardo",37,"1",2004-01-01,"pp. 63-70","10.2307/1577576","The MIT Press","fla","","The author has identified four fundamental organizational principles common to both organic form and the creation of visual composition. The author proposes that our perceptual system has evolved to respond to these principles (perceptual primitives) due to the necessity of recognizing the diversity of organic forms on which our survival depended during our earlier evolution. The evidence shows that these four principles occur widely throughout humankind's aesthetic expression in different cultures, epochs, art forms and media. Applying von Humboldt's principle, the author proposes that these limited means provide unlimited possibilities for developing student creativity if it were taught as a coherent grammar."

At the same time, however, some artists are exploring the electronic networks as specific socio-technical structures with their respective forms of social and machinic agency, in which people and machines interact in ways unique to this environment. The author discusses recent projects that use the Net as a performative space of social and aesthetic resonance in which notions of subjectivity, action and production are being articulated and reassessed. This text discusses the notion of ""resonance"" in order to think through these approaches to network-based art practices."

Each has employed cartographic methodology as an interaction metaphor in the design of dynamic, evolving systems that allow participants to create and archive their own itineraries and maps on-line. These systems explore the aesthetic dimensions of the database. The authors have presented and tested proto-types of two developing systems, ""Subtract the Sky"" and ""A Map Larger Than the Territory,"" in a workshop/exhibition. This article provides a brief description of the premise and implementation of both projects. It concludes with some preliminary findings from the workshop/exhibition and the authors' shared research."

The author proposes that interactive technologies return us to forms of communication similar to the rituals of primitive societies. Feedback and emergent behaviors effected through tele-immersion, remote action and self-organizations related to the lives of snakes are intended to provide the sensation of being in a day-dreaming state."

Its aim is to improve the use of imagination in artworks using abstract images in the formats of interactive media and vibro-tactile aids. New technologies can visually realize every surrealistic narration we can imagine, but these technologies limit our perceptions by presenting only one way of imagining, instead of multiple alternatives. This restricts creative thinking. Working from the above assumption, this article explores how to increase the degree of imagination in an interactive artwork. The author discusses problems of the imagination in art and interactive media and summarizes current research on vibro-tactile and vibro-acoustic applications.

The author asks whether this practice, which seems to stem from aesthetic concerns, is sufficiently critical in regards to current trends in genetic engineering."

Quintet.net implements, in a virtual environment, the metaphor of five performers under the control of a conductor, thus dealing with important aspects of symbolic, aural and visual communication among the participants and the network audience. A composition development kit has been added to the environment (which consists of Client, Server, Listener, Conductor and Viewer) to facilitate the development of pieces that take full advantage of the wide continuum between composition and improvisation."

Abstract art has often been regarded as beyond the purview of such interpretations because of the very fact that it is abstract. However, as a visually guided activity, abstraction is eminently suited to an analysis from this perspective. This essay will demonstrate how such an approach can reap rich rewards in the understanding of why and how art came to progress from an earlier representational phase to one of abstraction by examining some of the 20th century's most influential trends."

Hockney, Falco and the Sources of ""Opticality"" in Lorenzo Lotto's ""Husband and Wife""","Christopher Tyler","Leonardo",37,"5",2004-01-01,"pp. 397-401","10.2307/1577681","The MIT Press","fla","","In his book ""Secret Knowledge,"" David Hockney proposes that the ""optical quality"" of Flemish art arose around 1420, because artists such as van Eyck then began to use optical devices for accurate projection of subject images onto the canvas. Although Hockney describes Lotto's ""Man and Wife"" as the ""Rosetta Stone"" of his argument, the author's analysis reveals that its perspective structure is incompatible with the logic of local optical projection. Regions that should be geometrically coherent in an optical projection display pronounced distortions, while regions that should be incoherent show no such distortions. Such detailed evidence, as well as the inability of optical projection to capture the effect of windblown garments, is inconsistent with Hockney's claim."

Different periods of Mondrian's life correspond to distinct types of nonfigurative compositions, but can the distinction be formalized? How many bits or numbers are needed to characterize a typical composition? Can the rules of a composition type be expressed in the language of the computer? If distinct composition types require different computer programs, can these be based on a common framework, a mechanism, perhaps? The findings presented here are only tentative, but it is interesting to note that some characteristics can be modeled reasonably well, whereas others still resist formalization in the presented framework. The author's approach borrows principles from genetic programming. Employing a built-in random number generator, it can be used to explore a large space of ""compositions."""

The author interprets this visual phenomenon in the context of entropic skins geometry, which he has developed to describe the geometry and statistics of turbulent flows. Finally, the author argues that the form just under Mona Lisa's left shoulder can be interpreted as a human skull anamorphosis, as a kind of ironic signature by Leonardo."

The author addresses this limitation through analysis of ""converse"" and ""pseudoscopic"" 3D images--Charles Wheat-stone's two paradigms for inverting binocular depth. Wheatstone's inverted imagery proves geometrically identical to 3D art-historical precedents that conceal their perspective inversion: namely, relief sculpture, set design and architecture employing three-dimensionally ""forced"" perspective. As hinted by depth-inverted stereograms, linear perspective employed together with reversed overlapping cues systematically inverts unlimited space in both 2D and 3D pictures."

The author's perspective analysis on the image of this carpet shows that, while there is a ""break"" in perspective consistent with refocusing or tipping of an optical projector, there are also other larger, more significant perspective deviations that are inconsistent with the use of a projector. After presenting a simple sensitivity analysis of these results and rebutting anticipated objections, the author concludes by rejecting the claim that optical projections were used in the creation of this still life."

In the 4th century B.C. philosophical analysis of knowledge identified three essential elements for science: the idealistic view that concepts are real and that things are unreal imitations of concepts (associated with Platonic philosophy); the naturalistic view that things are real and concepts are intellectual constructs, important but not real (associated with Aristotelian philosophy); the logical apparatus essential for the intellectual manipulation of scientific knowledge (transmitted by the writings on logic of Aristotle). Only where these three elements have been available has science occurred. The visual fine arts faithfully follow later ascendancies of the two opposing views of reality: the highly idealistic early European Christian culture produced non-naturalistic art, extremely idealized; the dominance of the Aristotelian philosophy in the High Middle Ages was accompanied by a revival of naturalism in the arts; the Renaissance, in which both philosophical views were again available, resulted in highly naturalistic art used to portray idealistic conceptions. It was also during the Renaissance that, for the first time since Classical Greek Antiquity, the three essential elements for science were brought together: Platonic idealism, Aristotelian naturalism and logic. It is with this event that what is called modern science began."

In this article he discusses first the historic spatial and temporal limitations of music and the visual arts. He then describes how, in his sonic and visual experiments, he has attempted to liberate these artforms from their traditional bounds. By programming and combining the non-material elements of space, light and time as well as the concrete forms deriving from them (such as architecture, film, video, dance and literature) he has sought to bring together various disciplines that have been separated since the Renaissance. His work involves contemporary technology, such as the computer. He foresees a 'collective choreography' of the visual and sonic spaces of cities, involving the creative interaction of artist and public."

Using this definition, the author proposes a paradigm for archaeological fiction based on a story by Jorge Luis Borges entitled ""Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius"". (In this story, all of the aspects of a hypothetical culture are documented in an encyclopedia which is published by a secret society of artists and scientists.) The author then describes his most recent exhibition, The Excavation of the Apasht, and identifies aspects of the work which are derived from this paradigm. In concluding, issues related to archaeological fiction are addressed."

It is argued that the most recent developments in micro-electronics have made computer art accessible to a large number of artists and amateurs. As a result, computer graphics will play an increasing role in studies of the theory of art, in education, and in entertainment, as well as in the shaping of the visual environment. Initial applications of computer graphics to traditional two-dimensional formats have now been superseded by more revolutionary modes of expression. It is argued that computer art could be considered an example of a 'gentle' technology that will gain more importance as large numbers of individuals are able to explore its potential."

Contrasting Clement Greenberg's art history narrative to the more recent writings of Joseph Masheck, the author indicates how the tradition of Byzantine aesthetics and a study of icons provide a novel framework for the discussion of modern abstract painting. Refusing to describe these recent works as the latest stage in a long process of historical development, Masheck's texts force us to think for ourselves about the general lessons implicit in his assembled examples."

The author, an Egyptian by birth, has employed the principle of the periodic production of shadows by the Sun as the Earth rotates around the Sun and around its axis in his Solar Bas-Reliefs. The objects consist of a surface in relief made of many elements, each capable of casting an individual shadow. The elements are designed to produce different ratios of sunlit to shaded areas and, in an ensemble, have been employed to produce figurative images. The author describes in detail Solar Bas-Reliefs consisting of two types of shadow-casting elements. He calls attention to his first full-scale installation (1978) at Les Halles in Paris, which displays the image of a lion cub between noon and 14.00 hours on sunny days."

Their experience in working with the material began when they were commissioned to build an outdoor altar. The sculptures that followed were inspired by the altar, which emphasized a union of a sculpture with the Earth. A number of their sculptures are illustrated and the ideas underlying them are discussed. The works display continuity in two seminal ideas but rather large variations in scale and in types of stone used. They tell about their manner of work as a team and their participation in sculpture symposia."

She discusses in particular the Ostwald color system as a means for classifying colors in a meaningful way and for providing a large gamut for her use. She tells of her initial preparation of color charts representative of those in the Ostwald system. She outlines her procedure for the selection of colors and for the preparation and application of opaque oil paint mixtures to canvas to produce paintings that provide the illusion of transparency and of shapes in motion. Representative examples of her paintings are presented. The procedure described may be applied to other types of painting."

Homospatial Thinking in the Creative Process","Albert Rothenberg","Leonardo",13,"1",1980-01-01,"pp. 17-27","10.2307/1577915","The MIT Press","fla","","There is a widespread belief that inspirations from unconscious sources play an important role in creativity in the arts, the sciences and other fields. Similarly, many sophisticated persons believe that analogic thinking (the construction of analogies) is significant. Research done by the author, consisting of extensive and intensive interviews focused on the creative process of a large number of persons concerned with innovation and invention, and controlled psychological experiments, indicates that a conscious and intentional type of process, designated as homospatial thinking, plays a major role. This process consists of actively conceiving two or more discrete entities occupying the same mentally represented space or spatial location, a conception leading to the articulation of new identities. Many seemingly unconscious effects, as well as presumed products of analogic thinking, such as effective linguistic and visual metaphors, are derived from this special type of thinking. Although there is a good deal of data regarding the operation of this process in the literary arts, music and the sciences, the focus here is on its role in the visual arts. The end product of homospatial thinking in the visual arts, the visual metaphor, is defined and described in connection with works by Kokoschka, Moore, and Leonardo Da Vinci. A series of observations by artists from different periods of history with diverse types of styles and orientations is then provided to clarify and document the role and mode of operation of the homospatial thought process."

The problem is of practical importance to a large number of artists teaching in Britain. The concept of research in other fields is briefly considered in order to arrive at a useful definition of the concept. Research in visual art is found to be a cognitive rather than an expressive activity and can therefore be compared with types of scientific and scholarly research. Reference is distinguished from research by the element of time. By citation of works by past and contemporary artists, research in the visual arts was found to be of three types: research into art, research for art and art as research. Rather than being a manifesto, the report aims at clarification of the subject. It is not suggested that visual art should be considered as research but that some such art can be research and should be so considered."

During the course of preparing three series of works, he chose a classification system wherein each work is designated by a code consisting of four numbers: the number of closed curves employed in constructing the basic shape of a work and three numbers for line intersections of the types V, T and X found in the shape. The classification system is of interest to him, because it provides a basis for establishing a kind of order among his works. It also serves as an aid in pointing to shapes that he should consider for use in future works."
"10.2307/1577978","Music and Visual Color: A Proposed Correlation","Alan Wells","Leonardo",13,"2",1980-04-01,"pp. 101-107","10.2307/1577978","The MIT Press","fla","","The author tells of events leading up to finding a possible link between musical harmony and visual color based on complementarity. He points out that an equal division of the musical octave into 12 half-steps permits one to recognize chords built on tones occurring at the interval of half an octave or the tritone interval as being complementary to each other. This corresponds to the equal spacing of 12 hues on a color circle in which complementary hues are located diametrically opposite each other. A circular form of the musical octave divided according to the chromatic scale of 12 half-steps places tones serving as roots for complementary chords diametrically opposite each other also. There seems to be a parallel between the equal division of the color circle into 3 primaries and 3 secondaries and the equal division of the musical circle into 6 whole steps or the whole-tone scale. In both circles, colors and chords that can be classified as secondaries are complementary to the primaries and vice versa. The near-complements of a color lying on either side of its complement are more subdued in contrast with the color than the complement is. Chords built on tones on either side of a tritone interval from a given tonal center on the musical circle also produce subdued contrast with a chord built on the tonal center. The relationship of the adjacent chords to a chord built on the tonal center is as of sub-dominant to tonic and dominant to tonic, which is the harmonic basis of the diatonic system."

J. Gibson's ecological approach to visual perception. He points out that the digital computer model should be rejected in favour of the analogue model for operation of the human nervous system and the classical information theory of communications systems in favour of Gibson's resonance hypothesis. However, he believes that in order to uphold the resonance hypothesis it is necessary to make use of the concept of sensations, which Gibson rejected. He concludes by stating that it is by reference to the instants of perception given by attention to the sensations that accompany perception that one is brought close to achieving a description of what perception is like."

An assumption of parallelism between physical, biological and ethical principles allows him to reach across them. Accordingly, his works on the psychology of visual art provoke pressing questions about the limits of parallelism, that is, of the possible links between value, meaning, pictorial configurations and their elements and the role of personal or idiosyncratic interpretations of visual artworks."

In Part I, sculptor Rob Fisher discusses the integration of computer-aided design with traditional sculptural approaches in his site-specific projects. He points out that the computer-aided design process in the project ""Northern Lights"" allowed him to deal with complex problems of site, structural engineering, and pre-visualization while preserving the intimacy of studio art. In the project ""Galaxy,"" the computer graphics model was highly flexible and transformable, freeing the design process from the constraints of traditional maquettes, which often fix a work prematurely. In Part II of the article, architect/programmer Raymon Masters outlines the computer programs and technical aspects of designing ""Galaxy"". He sees the computer as a creative tool for enhancing intuitive response and direct visual observation, pointing out that computer-aided sculpture is in a state of flux as new demands shape both the medium and its products."

The author associates his paintings with 'polyvariant' musical compositions and compares the appreciation of paintings to that of music."

The Caricature Generator program is used to create caricatures by amplifying the differences between the face to be caricatured and a comparison face. This continuous, parallel amplification of facial features on the computer screen simulates the visualization process in the imagination of the caricaturist. The result is a recognizable, animated caricature, generated by computer and mediated by an individual who may or may not have facility for drawing, but who, like most human beings, is expert at visualizing and recognizing faces."

The forms discussed connect constituent elements in a logical manner. The authors emphasize the necessity for some mental procedure to interpret the 'impossible' forms. Dynamic structures and various kinds of 'attractors' are discussed in connection with the visualization of motion. Self-organization, a popular concept for understanding the spatio-temporal development of evolving forms, is presented as a means to rationalize the continuous organization of lines as the cooperative organization of discrete entities.

Natural selection, which in the past guided progressive evolution, must today be augmented by 'conscious selection' of advances based on human goals and values.

The central principle that moves our society is the demand that the basis of action shall be verifiable knowledge. This is a public knowledge that is open to the scrutiny of every member of society and has come to be called science. To test impersonally what is conjectured requires mechanical laboratory apparatus but mechanical watchdogs against bias have nothing to do with the content of knowledge. By the end of the 19th century a scientist had come to be regarded as a living extension of his own apparatus and it was expected that in time he would prove that man is a machine also. The author believes that this image has had the catastrophic consequence of provoking irrational crusades against all technology. In order to overcome this situation, intellectuals, artists above all, must shape a new imagery of science as understood in the 20th century-science cannot have the inhuman, mechanical kind of exactness ascribed to it in the 19th century and he gives reasons why this is so. The preoccupations of science have been moving from physics to biology, a historical subject. Man's evolution has been culture-driven and a central component in the ascent of man has been the manipulation of mental imagery and its expression in language and other symbolisms. Art is a powerful mover of the mind, for it helps to project thoughts forward, to form plans and to enlarge knowledge. For problems of conduct, general plans or grand strategies are devised that are called human values. Thus values are now seen as an integral part of the biological nature of man, of which the search for knowledge is a biological necessity."

She traces factors that have affected her work throughout. These are: her interest in philosophy, the use of arcs and ellipses in her works, a quest for ways to achieve a sense of depth and her fascination with transparency and surface reflections. She believes that her theistic view of life is expressed in her constructed designs and balanced compositions, whether she depicts nonfigurative subjects or Christ figures or sculpted forms derived from nature, and, particularly, in the continuity of their lines. Skiing, sailing and gliding appeal to her, because they involve finding and following a 'right' line or curve. Her works sometimes recall wakes in water, ski tracks in snow and the shapes of trees. But she regards her interior, mental images as an equally meaningful influence that she wishes to share. She attempts, in her article, to resolve present-day conflicts and paradoxes confronting some visual artists, such as protest or acceptance, art or nature, expert opinion or personal choice, to arrive or to move on, and illustrates her approach to them through her work."

He gives his reasons for choosing such a design for the Ramot Housing Complex, consisting of apartment units, located on a hilly, rocky terrain near Jerusalem. The final application combines the use of both dodecahedra and a cubic array provided by an arrangement of dodecahedra. The array presents the advantage of structural strength and the dodecahedra are used for providing both exterior walls compatible with the surrounds and interior walls that are suited for human habitation."

M. L. Teuber (1976) has shown that at different periods of his life Klee varied the way in which he used lines to refer to physical features. During the period 1925-1931, in the Bauhaus group at Dessau, Germany, for example, he used lines to suggest the transparency of overlapping planes. Recent work in the field of digital computers has revealed the existence of systems of 'rules' that underlie the ways in which lines can refer to physical features. One rule that is common in such systems is that a line should refer to the same feature throughout its length, and this is a rule that Klee often violated. During the last two years of his life, Klee produced a number of paintings and drawings in which lines represent the bounding contours of smooth forms. A method is described for analyzing such pictures. When these pictures by Klee are analyzed, digressions from the rules are revealed. It is argued that in many cases Klee deliberately introduced such digressions to obtain expressive effects and that these effects are appropriate to the subject matter of the pictures."

H. Gombrich's view that the method possesses objective validity. The status of those compensations made when viewing perspective pictures from 'incorrect' positions is discussed in relation to Gombrich's distinction between the 'how' and 'what' of visual perception. After arguing that accounts of compensation cannot distinguish between perspective pictures and nonperspective pictures or verbal descriptions of the depicted scenes, the author analyzes the concept of convention. He notes that conventions may be thought of in two different ways. Either a convention is arbitrary or it is the result of innate human characteristics and, therefore, in a sense, objective. He suggests that Gombrich's writings may support the claim that perspective is an objective method of representation. He places this particular debate within the context of Gombrich's general view of art history."
"10.2307/1578106","Principal Shadows of the 12 Pentagonal Regular 4-Dimensional Objects (Polytopes)","B. L.

This involves imagining a point source of light at infinite distance in the dimensional space in which the object is located, shining on the object and casting a shadow on a 3-dimensional hyperplane behind it. This shadow will have three dimensions. If the object is a polytope, the shadow is a polyhedron. There are 16 polytopes in four dimensions that are regular, that is, the cells that bound them are all regular polyhedra, all of the same type, with the same configuration at each vertex. Of the 16 regular polytopes, 12 are pentagonal: They all have the same symmetry group, denoted by [3,3,5], with order 14400. Because they are so complicated, these pentagonal forms are especially difficult to visualize. Of the available techniques of visualization, the one which best displays their basic structure is probably the shadow method. This paper shows the principal shadows of the 12 pentagonal polytopes, which are the shadows with the highest possible degree of symmetry. Interesting features of these shadows and the ways that they are related to each other are presented."

He discusses the function of the staff seminar, the formation of a new curriculum based upon cooperating teams of humanists and scientists, the planning and offering of public events that bring science and humanities to common focus and the dissemination of NEXA throughout a 19-campus system by means of consultations, conferences and workshops. His discussion continues with an historical summary of the so-called 'two-cultures' dilemma, whose origins are traced to the 17th century and whose consequences for the 19th- and 20th-century experience are examined in some detail. Specific attention is paid to the new field of sociobiology as an example of scientific reductionism. The present plight of the humanities is considered in terms of both neglect and abuse. The role of logical positivism as a failed bridge between science and humanities is examined, as are possible future alternatives for a rehumanized philosophy. The author then considers 'the new humanities', defined as the study of human culture in both its major manifestations--scientific and humanistic--coequally, employing a convergent approach to determine the generic 'form' (in Henri Frankfort's sense) of Western civilization. He concludes with an invitation to professionals in many fields to join NEXA in this enterprise."

The main controlling parameters are accuracy and precision, but the plotter mechanism may impose a stepped or ragged structure on lines. Thus while they may remain within tolerance, their visual quality is affected. Pens for plotters must be chosen for reliable operation under conditions of mechanical handling, usually without continuous supervision. Users can influence the quality of their drawings by appropriate choice of drawing procedure, particularly by ensuring that the result depends on the precision rather than the accuracy of the plotter."

And for centuries it has been associated with serious health effects. Every phase of painting with lead carries some hazard: from using raw pigments in making the paints to restoring old paintings. For this reason, it is both wise and ethical to replace lead with safer substances whenever possible. However, in some instances, serious aesthetic requirements may be met best by using lead materials. In these cases, careful preparations should be made to use lead safely. These include providing appropriate ventilation, protective equipment and facilities for good hygiene and cleaning. When used in this thoughtful, professional manner, lead can be used without harm."

The author describes how her paintings and drawings build on the evolutionary themes of biological, technological and social transformations. She places images associated with specific scientists and architects in contexts that emphasize these transformations. Her work explores an organic basis of technological and architectural shapes. The resulting forms, which often appear futuristic, contrast with her fresco-like technique of fifteenth-century panel painting. Her experiences as a painter have encouraged her to view technology's forms as contemporary icons that are rooted in nature."

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the 'cabinet of curiosities' mixed artworks with objects which today would belong in a museum of natural history or a museum of the history of science. In the eighteenth-century French Salon, visual artworks were displayed in ways that led to the creation of a new form of writing, art criticism. Contrasting these displays with those of the modern museum, we may understand some of the differences between present-day commercial art and art involving technology, which is a special concern of ""Leonardo."""

In most media, this is best accomplished by increases in the collative aspects of artworks (e.g. novelty, complexity, incongruity). These increases are achieved by movement toward more primary process cognition by successive artists during the inspirational stage of creation. When this becomes difficult, impossible or counterproductive, stylistic change occurs and the process begins anew. The theory was tested on a series of Italian paintings produced between the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries. Naive subjects rated color slides of the paintings on scales designed to tap the variables of theoretical interest. Results were in conformity with theoretical predictions."

Although layering techniques are an outgrowth of well-developed twentieth-century methods and do not represent a new style, layering is a perceivable development in contemporary art characterized by a synthesis of technique and holistic thinking.

Artists have shown technology heightening as well as diminishing human stature. In some views, humans are ennobled by their technological achievements--gaining pride and dignity from great feats of engineering and mechanical expertise--while in satirical art, people are depicted showing feelings of alarm and anxiety as they attempt to adapt to new machines. Twentieth-century art has sometimes suggested that humans are becoming machinelike--featureless automatons who have lost their emotions and individuality. To counter dehumanization, artists often see their task as one of taming technology and using it for creative rather than destructive purposes."

He traces how photography and recording have precipitated changes and hastened the natural evolution of new forms in art and music by allowing artists to document their compositions and distribute them to wider audiences. The author then examines technology's deeper influences, as seen in audience receptivity to new art and in the changing relationships of artists and composers to their crafts. As composers and artists respond to technology--by adapting their art for recording, incorporating technology into their works, or developing new forms that cannot be recorded or will not compete with the products of technology--art and the artist are redefined."

Visual imagery provides a context within which to explore the apparent confrontation between science and the media which is here presented as based on the relationship between image and reality. This link generates the associated but distinct notions of sight, perception and conception, and forms the groundwork for the author's argument centred on illusion and delusion. Alternative sensor systems to the eye are shown to have a significant influence on our image of the world, and it follows that image manipulations (analysis, enhancement, distortion) have a tangible impact on perception. It thus becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between objective and subjective worlds or between the underlying standards of scientist and artist. By recognizing that the reliance of sight on symbolism suggests that the visual model may well be an allusion, we take a step towards closing the gap between science and the visual media."

The structure of the eye, the nerve connections between the eye and the brain, and the visual cortex can give us clues as to how human perception is uniquely sensitive. These sensitivities, amplified through the self-expression of artists, can induce emotional responses that are more related to the form of the expression than to the content of the imagery. Works by the author and by other artists who influenced him are used to illustrate these points."

Her focus has been the illusion of matter and its equivalence with energy. A desire to resolve the problems of duality has led her to an understanding of cyclic matriarchal societies of the past in which change and flow were accepted and duality was unknown. She believes she still holds fragments of a matriarchal past in her unconscious and juxtaposes its hidden imagery with contemporary materials and technology."

This relationship is first addressed via a description of the roaring 1920s in terms of the sale of a pickle. Then the author discusses his research and creation of format music involving melodious, dissonant, rise/fall resonances in the upper oral regions of the vocal tract. This is 'whisper music' made by differing the shapes of the oral cavity through postures of the tongue, lips and jaws. Third, an alphabetic notation for performance called 'prosodynic print' is introduced. Here, distorted but readable letters act as cues to instruct readers to speak levels of intensity, pitch and duration of vowels, i.e. modulation of voiced speech. Relations of voiced speech through the larynx and pharynx of the lower vocal tract with oral resonances in the upper vocal tract are discussed."

Through dialogue with the model, the artist is no longer limited by the material constraints or the irreversibility of real actions. By emphasizing the process rather than the object, the computer enables formalizing of the creative act and the application of formal categories of discourse. Graduating from the hand to the brain and becoming 'intelligent', the tool gives new meaning to the concept of artistic creation and endows the visual artist with a new attitude which leads to 'procedural art'. In order to define this concept, the author first relates the adventures which led him to change from a traditional painter to a designer of software for artists. He then describes his Anyflo system of three-dimensional animation and synthesis which uses the concept of procedural art in relation to teaching and the production of works generated by computer."

Campbell interprets his turning to sculpture as a natural outgrowth of this early work as a painter of geometric, hard-edge abstractions. He relates sculptural form in his carvings to such primitive elements as gravity, volume, weight, mass and color of individual stones. His site works mingle metaphors derived from myth, art history and astronomy with others that are technological, sociological and topological."

His fascination with the limitlessness of space has motivated him to work with three-dimensional forms. Following sculptural investigations involving geometric objects and the intersections of planes in space, he began combining natural objects with handmade forms or spaces in installations invoking a dialogue between geometric and biological forms. The author also discusses his working methods and materials and in the final section summarizes his approach to art."

Although records have traditionally been regarded as preserved performances, he proposes viewing them as a compositional format. He also discusses the influence of the I Ching on the structure and imagery associated with the works on the record as well as the compositional approach found in each piece."

The social constructionist perspective implies that self-portraits will have different meanings at different epochs due to changing conceptions of the self and the complex relationships between social and economic conditions, ideas about appearance and the significance of portraits. Self-presentation theory implies that self-portraits will be read in terms of motives for self-presentation. Some relevant findings are discussed from a study that asked students to attempt to distinguish between portraits and self-portraits made by the same artists. Respondents were more accurate with Modern than with Baroque pictures and seemed to base their identifications on imputed artists' intentions and the sitters' psychological expressions."

It was initiated in 1971 by a choreographer who suggested using a computer to interpret dance notation to produce an animated figure. The authors trace the steps involved in devising their system and, by commenting on both its advantages and its disadvantages, identify ways of further improving its design. It is hoped that new technology will increase the speed of the system and reduce its cost, making it a useful tool for choreographers, dancers and dance schools."

The struggle is traced in terms of six dimensions: technological, theoretical, political, institutional, economic and cultural. The author's position is that video mutated from a countercultural gesture to an art genre. The question asked is how this genre will articulate its own genealogy."

Video recordings and dance notation provide some solutions, but create new problems as well. The solution of these problems using computers is discussed, as well as several other uses of computers in dance and various ways of getting dance information into a computer. The specific computing problems encountered in the ""Computers and Dance"" program at the University of Sydney are briefly described. The bringing together of dance and computing is shown likely to have substantial benefits for both disciplines. In computing, it will expand the horizons of computer graphics, solid modelling, expert systems and dynamic analysis. The most interesting impact of dance on computing is likely to be in expanding the dimensionality of thought of programmers from the one-dimensional mind-set of an alphanumeric string to the four dimensions required for visualising Petri nets."

Ruin time, proposed as the principal cause of ruin, serves also to unify the ruin. In a ruin the edifice, the human-made part, and nature are one and inseparable; an edifice separated from its natural setting is no longer part of a ruin since it has lost its time, space and place. A ruin has a signification different from something merely human-made. It is like no other work of art and its time is unlike any other time."

First, a 4-dimensional analogue of a rolling 3-dimensional die is imagined in 4-space according to geometric properties. Second, it is projected orthogonally into 3-space as a solid that is shown by orthogonal projection onto a plane. Lastly, this procedure is applied to other images to illustrate additional 4-dimensional analogues of 3-dimensional objects."

Many theorists emphasize Modernism's optimism and predominantly metaphorical vision and characterize Postmodernism as the pessimistic era of the 'failed metaphor'. The author argues that the more unfamiliar and creative aspects of Postmodernism have been largely overlooked and that Postmodernism can be viewed both as a substantial alternative to Modernism and as a significant movement in its own right."

Aviation art is representational art that records, celebrates and interprets aviation for an audience with occupational and hobby interests. The quality of aviation art has improved over the years as efforts have been made to popularize the art and to increase communication among practitioners. Aviation art testifies to a continuing public fascination with aviation and provides a visual documentation of one of the preeminent technologies of the twentieth century."

He considers works in concrete and neon to be both images of the modern world and reflections of an ancient one."

Space as a musical parameter is overviewed, the potential areas and concurrent limitations of spatial music composition are described, and the likely causes of perceptual mismatch between the composer and the listener are reviewed. Headphone music as a solution to the mismatch problem is proposed, and a description of the spatial signal-processing technique developed by the author is given. The compositional considerations used in two computer music headphone compositions, Revelations by the author and ""Begault Meadow"" by Gordon Mumma, conclude the discussion."

The text is in three parts. In the first part, a compositional task environment typical for the mid-1980s is discussed, to demonstrate the heterogeneity of tools a composer needs when creating a musical work. The second part presents a written lecture-demonstration of a compositional process for producing a score for saxophone solo. In the third part, an abstract model of compositional problem-solving is proposed using the blackboard paradigm from artificial intelligence research. The point of the article is to show that, far from inhibiting compositional intuition, the computer program has become an indispensable alter ego for composers who care to work systematically. The article proposes a framework for studies in composition theory as a discipline based on artificial intelligence."

Kirsch","Leonardo",23,"1",1990-01-01,"pp. 99-106","10.2307/1578473","The MIT Press","fla","","Images of artworks can be stored in media that preserve different characteristics of the original. Differences exist in the extent to which we can preserve color, three-dimensionality, surface texture, fine structure, tonal gradations, temporal variations and other characteristics that lend uniqueness to individual artworks. Usually, we are willing to sacrifice some of these characteristics in exchange for the permanence and recoverability offered by storage media. Thus, a color slide (diapositive), which is a common medium for storing images of artworks, compromises all of the above properties to different extents but is nevertheless considered useful for the archival properties it offers for images of artworks. Digital storage media used in conjunction with computers offer new opportunities and demand new compromises in storing art images. An unusual challenge is offered by the possibility of providing intelligence to a computer. The authors make clear the sense in which we may ascribe intelligence to the computer and how this may be used to 'perceive' the image of an artwork. The computer then uses its knowledge of the artwork with respect to a large class of such works not only for archival storage but also to achieve economy in the use of the storage medium. The authors illustrate the achievement of storage economy as much as tens of thousands of times greater than storage without intelligence. The intelligence is provided to the computer as syntactic descriptions of classes of artworks. The syntactic descriptions incorporate insight from the art historian, critic or artist who uses innovative tools like shape grammars to provide the computer with a small part of the intelligence that the educated human viewer brings to the perception of the artwork."

Wherever van Gogh lived, he recorded both day-to-day changes in the weather and dominant characteristics of the climate with only the small degree of exaggeration typical of many artists. Van Gogh represented atmospheric visibility as lowest in Paris, where urban air pollution had already become a serious problem. Although he seldom devoted great attention to precise cloud forms, the obviously distorted cumulus and mountain wave clouds he painted in Saint-Rémy reveal with a perspicacity exceptional in Western art how clouds mark the air's flow patterns. Even the bleak settings of his final works in Auvers had their meteorological underpinnings, for the weather of the first 3 weeks of July 1890 was truly dismal."

Leonardo da Vinci advocated the use of untidy indeterminacies for working out composition, because he believed that they stimulated visual invention. Recent research in cognitive psychology suggests a mental-imagery model that expands Leonardo's theory and provides evidence for cognitive mechanisms that clarify the function of familiar sketch attributes. Sketches may mediate mental translation between spatially depictive and structurally descriptive modes of visual representation. Evidence for a hybrid percept-image theory of ordinary paper sketching is briefly outlined. Some implications of this theory for the development of improved computer sketching systems are briefly discussed."

Three-dimensional representation will stimulate visual artists to work and think in new ways, for their concern will no longer be the problem of perspective, which will be handled by the computer, but rather the spatial design of objects and sceneries that can be expanded at will beyond the image on the screen. In its final stage of development, computer art might also be able to include elements of literature and to develop a plot in which the user, through interaction, can play a part."

These efforts constituted a determined attempt to document the emerging field of sky art and to discover and project forms of art in space. ""Desert Sun/Desert Moon"" was a series of temporary events and installations utilizing the temporal landscape of sky and space to evoke at the same time mythic and immaterial dimensions of that sky and space. Complementing these events, the SKY ART Manifesto is a working document drafted at the '86 SKY ART Conference. It offers artistic commitment to the future of art in space as an integral part of international exploration. The author describes ""Desert Sun/Desert Moon"" as it has emerged from the SKY ART Conferences and then presents the text of the SKY ART Manifesto. She comments on the importance of each regarding the practice and potential of sky art."

Status is considered to be an important factor in this relationship. Following the ideas of Thorstein Veblen on the so-called 'trickle effect', the role of status in determining the perceptions of consumers of art and architecture is considered. Consumers are little interested in the issues, invariably formal and abstract, that concern professionals. Artists and architects are urged to address themselves to these realities and engage in a genuine attempt to create for the marketplace if they wish to influence the character of the environment."

Basic principles of its design, together with variations of the system, are given as well as the method of painting used by the author. Examples of several works are shown. The picture produced by the system is considered from the point of view of real motion and of change of transparent color with time. The need for aesthetic guidelines for the kinetic painter is stressed. The author concludes that the Lumidyne system, after 10 years of experience with it, is a practical, controllable and economical artistic medium."

He discusses the principles of modular scale as well as the characteristics of the plane onto which the image is projected in perspective and the importance of taking the focal distance into account so as to control the projection according to a determined aperture of the visual field. The usage of the author's modular scale, whose design is based on the determination of the scale of depth, is shown in a graphical perspective."

Plastic, which was particularly versatile, was employed frequently by Naum Gabo and his brother Antoine Pevsner to realise the innovative sculptural forms advocated in their ""Realistic Manifesto"" of 1920. In Gabo's more organic works and linear compositions of the 1930s and 1940s, it can even be postulated that the development of acrylic plastics and filaments made such works possible. However, early plastics were extremely unstable and have discoloured, warped or even decomposed over time. The author explores the effect of deterioration on various works to demonstrate the urgent need for research on early plastics to aid the conservation of these sculptures."

Following Berlyne's views, an inverted U function should be obtained, i.e. a moderate amount of information would be most pleasing to the viewer. Informational density defined as amount of information was controlled through computer digitized manipulation of black-and-white art reproductions. Subjects included university students both with and without specific art training. Results tended to support a straight-line function of arousal (visual potency) ratings as associated with increasing informational density for untrained subjects, while an inverted U-shaped arousal curve in Berlyne's terms resulted for trained subjects. Continued application of information manipulation of art provides a useful technique for controlling and varying the visual structure of art in the study of aesthetic responses."

As can be judged from the available literature, most of these experiments still remain 'blank spaces' for Western readers. This article testifies to the existence of long-standing traditions that have inspired the Soviet school of music-kinetic art and have contributed to its original features. Perhaps the results have not always been as successful or as extensive as one would want them to be, but the prospects for future developments look promising, if only on the basis of the theoretical foundations that were laid in Russia itself in the beginning of this century.

The author suggests that Skinner's account can adequately encompass many creative phenomena, notably some recent, influential artistic approaches and the sex differences in productivity. However, the account also shows serious weaknesses. In particular, it implies that all individuals, including subhumans, are equally capable of creative behavior, and that an individual's creative acts, and his or her evaluation of them, must reflect the environment's standards. Moreover, Skinner has ignored important complications of creativity's definition and practice."

This emphasis on speech and text has meant that the areas of the brain's left hemisphere linked to these types of language processing are well exercised, while spatial reasoning, symbolic processing and pictorial interpretation, which seem to be tied to the right hemisphere, remain largely ignored. With the development of television and the microcomputer, print-based text no longer can monopolize our symbolic environment. The emphasis on text must be balanced by attention to graphic formats and the visual arts, by raising our consciousness of symbols, connecting text and graphics through language networks and creating a compatibility with our visual culture."

Reviewing art since World War I, the author finds not only important works proliferating in this form recently but also a definite history to be traced. The form first appears in the work of Marcel Duchamp, who was the first major artist to place the game of chess in an artistic context. Öyvind Fahlström made moveable paintings and some of the first original game-as-art works. Later, a large number of artists from diverse artistic backgrounds explored the game-as-art form. Some of these artists made innovations in traditional games, others used the form for a specific impact and still others created works to encourage social interaction. What is lacking is a set of criteria for judging the aesthetic qualities of a game-as-art work. The game-as-art form holds an aesthetic challenge to today's artists and promises to be an important art form of the future."

Algorithmic methods now make it possible for this knowledge to be expressed to a computer. Compared to the alternative of describing style in natural language, the computer methods offer the advantage that they can be tested for validity. The tests are accomplished by using the computer to generate new compositions in the style described. The authors demonstrate these methods with algorithmic descriptions of the styles of Richard Diebenkorn and Joan Miró and the generation of new compositions in their styles. A shape grammar algorithm for Diebenkorn is presented which accounts for the linear facture of his ""Ocean Park"" series. The problem of shape in Miró's work is tackled, and progress is reported on synthesizing composition in the style of his ""Constellation"" series. Further uses of algorithmic description of painting styles include mechanical storage, search and retrieval in art archives, attribution studies and diachronic studies of stylistic change."

Examples are drawn from various design disciplines with a particular focus on an analysis of Kandinsky's Bauhaus paintings."

Designers working on a space habitat not only must work on its functional role, but also must integrate functionality with mental representation and symbolic meaning. Space-connection interfaces such as doors and windows act as ""sensory organs"" of a building. They allow inside-out communication, but also allow the user to control the flow of light and air, which in a direct or indirect way are communication mediums. In this paper the authors advocate a closer connection among architecture, anthropology and psychology in designing space habitats as part of a new concept of environmental design strategy in space architecture."

Being connected exposes the liberating potential of connected public participation, which has changed our understanding of political and intimate life. At the same time there is a strong fear at work that this very potential could result in a more rigid form of contemporary life. Connection, as understood in this article, is something procedural that can at the same time be disobedient to its own procedure. This disobedience can be concretely observed in certain contemporary artistic works, for example in the project wPack from Intima Virtual Base."

The common properties of computer art and classical Islamic art can be understood in light of moments in the history of Islamic philosophy. In these two cases, Islamic Neoplatonism and Mu'tazili atomism are shown to parallel, respectively, the logic of relations between one and infinity, and the basic pixel structure, that inform some historical monuments of Islamic art as well as some contemporary works of computer art. It is suggested that these parallels are in part a result of Islamic influences on Western modernism and thus that the genealogy of computer art includes classical Islamic art and the philosophies that informed it."

This paper presents an ethnographic case study of cooperation between a computer programmer and an artist. It examines the processes of shared design, negotiated authorship and artwork appropriation. From an analysis of the means of communication, various technical media and ""intermediary tools,"" the author focuses on role allocation, task sharing and artwork appropriation as the artwork is modified throughout the creative process."

This network can be seen as parallel to the telematic networks that connect the planet. Nanotechnology can play a significant role in the emergence of a moistmedia substrate for technoetic art. Immaterial connectedness confers a spiritual dimension on both telematic art and quantum mechanics. Field theory supports the contention that the material body may be a consequence rather than a cause of consciousness. A technoetic art may locate its ground in the triangulation of connectivity, syncretism and field theory."

The existence of the whole can be felt in the parts, as something real, measurable and undeniable. Its simplicity and harmony are spiritually enriching and emotionally moving."

Building on this heritage and drawing on a host of related scientific disciplines, a framework for a strongly interdisciplinary psychology of aesthetics is proposed.

If these critiques are well founded, however, they are also nostalgic, invoking a notion of art as autonomous from the circuits of mass communication technologies, which the authors argue no longer holds true. This essay begins with a survey of the development of locative media, how it has distanced itself from net art and how it has been critically received, before going on to address these critiques and ponder how the field might develop."

He went on to lecture and write extensively to promote cybernetics and explain his approach to art, which was highly unconventional in the context of the times. Two directions emerged and remain the focus of his work today: the S-Band, an interactive art machine, and the Meta-Phorm, a behavioral geometry articulated by cybernetic mechanisms."

In the decade prior to the Islamic revolution, the Shiraz Arts Festival provided a showcase for composers, performers, dancers and theater directors from Iran and abroad, among them Iannis Xenakis, Peter Brook, John Cage, Gordon Mumma, David Tudor, Karlheinz Stockhausen and Merce Cunningham. A significant arts center, which was to include electronic music and recording studios, was planned as an outgrowth of the festival. While the complex politics of the Shah's regime and the approaching revolution brought these developments to an end, a younger generation of artists continued the festival's legacy."

The Lumidyne system developed by the author in 1956 is described in detail. Basic principles of its design, together with variations of the system, are given as well as the method of painting used by the author. Examples of several works are shown. The picture produced by the system is considered from the point of view of real motion and of change of transparent colour with time. The need for aesthetic guide lines for the kinetic painter is stressed. The author concludes that the Lumidyne system, after ten years of experience with it, is a practical, controllable and economical artistic medium. /// L'article explique brièvement les systèmes de peinture cinétique qui ont été inventés pour produire une composition illustrée sur une surface unie et translucide.

Les principes de base de cette construction, avec des variations du système, sont donnés ainsi que la méthode de peinture employée par l'auteur. Des exemples de plusieurs oeuvres sont montrés. L'image produite par le système est considérée sous l'aspect d'un mouvement réel et d'un changement de couleur transparent avec le temps. L'auteur insiste sur la nécessité de directives esthétiques pour l'artiste cinétique. Après dix ans d'expérience avec le système Lumidyne, l'auteur conclut que ce système est un moyen artistique qui est pratique, contrôlable et économique."

For me this is necessary since I work on two levels from a common set of attitudes: on the social level, elaborating plans for a Cybernetic Art Matrix; on the intimate level making individual art works. Both processes are concerned with creating triggers--initiating creative behaviour in the observer/participant. Modern art is characterized by a behaviourist tendency in which process and system are cardinal factors. As distinctions between music, painting, poetry, etc. become blurred and media are mixed, a behaviourist synthesis is seen to evolve, in which dialogue and feedback within a social culture indicate the emergence of a ""Cybernetic vision"" in art as in science. My artifacts come out of a process of random behaviour interacting with pre-established conditions. The Cybernetic Art Matrix is seen as a process in which anarchic group behaviour interacts with pre-established systems of communications, hardware and learning nets. In both cases the processes are self-generating and self-critical. Basically they are initiated by creative behaviour, and in turn give rise to its extension in other people. /// Il existe un paradoxe apparent en ce que, comme artistes, nous nous orientons peu à peu vers un processus tout en continuant à produire des objets d'art. Dans mon cas cela est nécessaire parce que je travaille sur deux plans, à partir d'un ensemble commun d'attitudes: sur le plan social, en élaborant des projets pour une Matrice d'Art Cybernétique; sur le plan individuel, en créant des oeuvres d'art personnelles. Ces deux processus ont pour but de susciter des déclics--ils déclenchent un comportement créateur chez le spectateur-participant. L'art moderne est caractérisé par une tendance behaviouriste dont le processus et le système sont les facteurs essentiels. Du fait que les différences entre la musique, la peinture, la poésie, etc., tendent à s'estomper et que les media se confondent, l'élaboration d'une synthèse behaviouriste est indispensable, où le dialogue et le 'feedback' au sein d'une culture sociale désignent l'émergence d'une Vision Cybernétique de l'art et des sciences. Les objets que j'ai réalisés sont le résultat d'un processus du comportement, laissé au hasard, et mis en relation avec des conditions pré-établies. La Matrice d'art Cybernétique est envisagée comme étant un processus dans lequel un comportement anarchique de groupe est mis en contact avec des systèmes de communication pré-établis, du matériel et des réseaux d'enseignement. Dans les deux cas, les processus se créent et se contrôlent eux-mêmes. Ils sont, à la base, issus d'un comportement créateur et donnent, à leur tour, l'élan à son développement chez le spectateur."

In particular, they consider two situations in which the photographic representation, although an accurate reproduction of the geometry of the two-dimensional image in the eye, does not capture the way human vision changes this geometry to produce a three-dimensionally accurate perception. When looking at a photograph, the viewer's uncertainty of the camera-to-subject distance and the fact that, unnaturally, a photograph presents almost exactly the same view of an object to the two eyes result in substantially distorted perceptions. These most commonly result in a perceived flattening and fattening of the 3D shape of the object being photographed."

Through Grosz, the author was led to study Brueghel, and the Dutch masters and their art, together with Byzantine mosaics and African sculpture, have remained a major influence in his work. A study of the paintings of De Hooch and Vermeer was also helpful from the point of view of the way those artists were able to control their large shapes, even when disparate elements were included within these shapes. Also, the author describes the influence upon him of examples of Chinese paintings and his method of working with mounted layers of torn papers. Both the similarities as well as the differences to Cubism in his style are described in detail, with the hope that the structural content of his work will be understood and even more valued than its social message. /// L'auteur explique le changement qui s'est opéré en lui, transformant l'étudiant en mathématiques qu'il était en peintre, et ce, après avoir étudié avec George Grosz.

Leurs œuvres, ainsi que les mosaïques byzantines et la sculpture africaine, devaient toujours avoir une influence primordiale sur l'auteur.

The second case study is of the avant-garde strategy of collective work, reinterpreted through the open-source work and interactive art of today. The author identifies three steps in the development of the 20th-century concept of joint creative work: avant-garde general strategies of artistic collaboration; avant-garde film works oriented toward creative collectivism; and collaborative artistic practices that manifest themselves in non-hierarchical strategies of contemporary interactive art."

Such an interest is confirmed by Russolo's admiration for Leonardo da Vinci. Leonardo's writings on music and acoustics constituted in fact a scientific and spiritual paradigm for Russolo; the former's mechanical musical-instrument projects were important models for Russolo's own, from 1913's intonarumori to the nuovo istrumento musicale a corde of 1931.

Can Leonardo's question, Libchaber's solution and notions of integrated systems be drawn together to create a whole?

Handsetting metal type necessarily focuses one's attention on the specificity of written language as a sequence of discrete letters. Each has properties of size, weight and shape; and placement and type styles can be widely varied. The technical constraints of letterpress tend to conserve the norm in the representation of language: line after straight line of a single typeface. The author's intention in deviating from these norms has been to extend, rather than negate or deny, the possibilities of meaning by encouraging plural readings at the levels of the word, the line and the page. Other issues such as the relation of language to experience, to literary tradition or to the social context in which it is produced are investigated."

The number of illustrated texts thus rose exponentially, increasing the rate of information transfer among scientists, engineers and the general public. The early American state geological reports, funded by the state legislatures, were among the pioneering volumes that used the new graphic capabilities in the improved printing processes for the advancement of science. They contain thousands of illustrations--woodcuts, etchings, lithographs and hand-painted maps--that may be of interest to historians of science, technology, art and culture."

A comprehension of these concepts is crucial to the calculation of both the painting's image formation and the observer's vantage point. To approach this problem in Leonardo da Vinci's ""Last Supper,"" the author introduces the reverse outlining perspective method, through which it is shown how the painting's image formation can be deduced."

The Vietnam War dramatically undermined public confidence in the promise of new technology, linking it with corporate support of the war. Ultimately, the discrediting of industry-sponsored technology not only undermined the premises of the LACMA exhibition but also may have contributed to the demise of the larger ""art and technology"" movement in the United States."

The author shows the context of Bonačić's work within the Zagreb cultural environment dominated by the New Tendencies movement and network (1961-1973). The paper shows his theoretical and practical criticism of the use of randomness in computer-generated art and describes his working methods as combining the algebra of Galois fields and an anti-commercial approach with custom-made hardware. It seems that Bonačić's work fulfills and develops Matko Meštrović's proposition that ""in order to enrich that which is human, art must start to penetrate the extra-poetic and the extra-human""."

The author shows how Leonardo analyzed the blurred edges of colored shadows with the geometric rigor that earlier authors afforded only to the clear-cut edges of astronomical shadows. She argues that the very kind of shadows that captured Leonardo's attention indicates his underlying pictorial concerns, despite the fact that his instructions often seemed directed toward teaching a way of seeing rather than a way of painting."

This paper examines remote sensing satellites as optical devices capable of redefining human cognition. They represent accessibility and openness through the more agreeable paradigm of transparency. However, transparency, like surveillance, is based on the interconnection between power, knowledge and perceptual experience. Artists use a variety of tactical practices, including amateurism, to tease apart these connections. Amateurism dedicates itself to the politics of knowledge. The author concludes, based on examples of her work and that of others, that the potential for political intervention exists when knowledge is paired with action."

With the help of recently developed implicit measures, both behavioral and biological, researchers are able to distinguish between explicitly reported knowledge and genuinely felt experience. The author presents examples of how art theory and empirical psychology might interact and how psychology can be used to examine a work's artistic value."

The 20th century revealed that Leonardo made substantial contributions in the domains of physics, mechanics, optics, perspective and medicine. Even so, nearly 500 years after his birth, much remains to be done in understanding fully one of the great geniuses of all time."

One can see motion flows through the material body, because all the fluid motions are consequent on the energy transmission. Furthermore, the energy transmission does not only exist on one individual, but also exist among groups gradually and continually underlain the energetic conservation. Dancers exercise their body everyday in the aim to discover and rehearse how the motion of the whole is duly evolved from their motor locus. The process by which motors provoke the whole motion is as mysterious as beautiful; therefore, the author realizes it in the virtual choreography, ""Fluente"". ""Fluente"" does not aim to present the fluid motion of human body but to explore the ""inner propagation"" existing within the real material bones, muscles, and our imagination as well. It comes from the center source with the vital breathe to flow as well to propagate perpetually."

This paper addresses this question through an examination of the artistic use of, and critical commentary on, media and available technologies, and of the artistic treatment of life forms found in the work of the younger generation of Slovenian artists (Tratnik, Berlot, Peljhan, Lovšin and others). The strategies these artists employ in their projects significantly strengthen the case for a re-articulation of the aesthetic, the ethical and the political, through a transition in various territories: art, (biotechnological) science, technology, new media and everyday reality."

The artist uses various strategies of mediation to inform this process, including live, recorded and research-driven forms of performance, and the exploration of mutuality, contestation and exchange between the singular and social body, culminating in the exposure of intimate distances. Through metonym and material, the viewer's attention is directed towards conceptual, visual and historical links between the celestial, organic and cellular corpus."

The paper goes beyond the economic or conservationist perspective, setting out the religious context with which the tree is perceived aesthetically in its natural environment. The practice of venerating the tree through decoration has, over time, effected cultural change in India. The tree is seen as a form that houses the sacred and thus is protected."

To this end, a framework for the design of kinetic architectural skins is presented for artists to consider as a potential resource for collaboration."

To the extent mean temperature increases, insect populations accelerate deforestation. This alters climate via the loss of active carbon sequestration by live trees and increased carbon release from decomposing dead trees. A self-sustaining positive feedback loop can then emerge. Extensive field recordings demonstrate that bioacoustic communication plays a role in infestation dynamics and is likely to be a critical link in the feedback loop. These results open the way to novel detection and monitoring strategies and nontoxic control interventions."

The resultant theories, like those of Leonardo, offer new conceptions of space and representation that challenge those who suggest the digital world will subvert the physical.

While the 3D-printed plastic elements contribute the aesthetics of the digital curvatures and manifolds, the hand-woven reed, jute, and canvas fibers infuse the baskets with a unique organic appeal.

But what if such a working graphic has as its target something that is simply incomprehensible? What are the upper limits of the denotational logic of such diagrams?

The images produced from these devices were, as Siegel puts it, akin to a ""psychic healing medium"" used to create ""mass cosmic consciousness, awakening higher levels of the mind, [and] bringing awareness of the soul."" While such radical and cosmic unions have ultimately failed, these unique color technologies nonetheless laid the foundation for colorism in the history of electronic computer art."

It is rarely as clear-cut as a simple linear influence of one to the other, partly because artists are able to envision all kinds of possibilities that technology might enable them to realize in some kind of form, but as they do so, the technology is itself shaped, especially in terms of how it is perceived by others. Do artists find a way to give technologies an aesthetic outlet, or do some technologies possess—or facilitate—a characteristic aesthetic that finds its expression through specific artists? Certainly, in the history of computer art it would seem that particular aesthetics, technologies, and artists are closely intertwined in certain periods. This intertwining of art, technology, and ideas stolen from the natural world has never been so arguably merged as the period in the history of computer art from 1980 to 1993. We take as the defining start of this period the initial work of Mandelbrot on fractals that became known as the Mandelbrot set and led to his famous illustrated art-science book The Fractal Geometry of Nature. In 1993, this first highly creative period in evolutionary computer art came to an end with major publications by pioneers Karl Sims, Stephen Todd, and William Latham."

On the one side is the instrumentalist trend toward the minimized or disappearing interface. On the other, some theorists and artists suggest that increased invisibility presents social and ethical concerns (such as invasiveness and control) when networking and communication devices are involved. The positivist side has roots in modernist design. Positivist designers create responsive and controllable fabrics using shape-changing polymers, e-textiles, and nano-scale electronics to resolve clumsy and prohibitive problems of hardware vs. body. The critical side draws upon archetypal ideas about technology and the body that are familiar from literature and science fiction, and includes writers and media artists who emphasize the intractable or mechanic nature of technological clothing to enhance, rather than erase, the body. The paper concludes that both positions must be considered as the field of technological fashion moves forward."

The fear of vulnerability to terrorist actions, including biological warfare and electronic interference, is exploited in these works, in order to expose the ways in which security is promised in exchange for control."

This system simultaneously highlights certain visual characteristics of multiple paintings, thus informing users of the links between paintings and the semantic elements that may appear superficially different, and also conveying the art-historical explanation of those characteristics. Through this system's evaluation, the approach based on ""the awareness of the visual characteristics"" may be effective as a method of developing the user's interest in the paintings. When this system is placed in museums and galleries as a mediation tool, it will be useful to a viewer's preparation for the art-viewing experience. This paper presents the concepts behind the system's development and the results of the first survey as a piece of a larger project to explore the improvement of painting appreciation as a museum experience."

We tested whether the use of known contemporaneous mechanical methods might explain this image evidence as well as the use of optical methods, also explaining additional physical evidence.

Pheromone—used by ants to communicate via the environment—is also simulated, and from the communication and interaction of the swarm with the environment (an image) there results a kind of drawing made with the simulated pheromone. Since ants are able to detect the edges of the image, the outcome is a sketch that resembles the original image, as with old camera obscura drawings. This text explores the observable traits shared by the photographic process and the swarm's pheromone maps. The theme is discussed in the context of the emergent artificial art research field; recent theoretical advances that link swarm intelligence and cognitive sciences are also addressed."

The author's goal is to create a context in which to understand the recourse to the crystal in contemporary art, specifically in the work of Roger Hiorns, David Altmejd and Gerard Caris. As a frame, the author examines Schopenhauer's, Worringer's and Deleuze and Guattari's adoption of the crystal as metaphor and material exemplar."

It uses projection to visualize virtual bugs on a real sandpit. The bugs are aware of their surroundings and respond to its form in their vicinity. By altering the topography of the sand, participants affect the bugs' environment in real time, facilitating direct communication between them and computer-generated creatures. This highly malleable and tactile physical environment lets us define and carve out the landscape in which the creatures exist in real time. Thus, virtual creatures and real people coexist and communicate through a shared tactile environment. Participants can use natural modes of play, kinesthetic intelligence, and their sense of tactility to collaborativeiy interact with creatures inhabiting a hybrid parallel world. This paper describes the project and analyzes how children in particular respond to the experience; it looks at the types of physical formations that tend to be built and notes how children instinctively anthropomorphize the bugs, treating projected imagery as living creatures - though with a ludic twist."

The project presents a vision of interactive dance performance that ""touches"" space by visualizing kinematics as intentionality and agency. In doing so, we suggest the possibility of new kinds of human-computer interfaces that emphasize touch as embodied, nuanced agency that is mediated by the subtle qualities of whole-body movement, in addition to more goal-oriented, task-based gestures such as pointing or clicking."

However, visual representations also have a rhetorical function: they demonstrate, persuade, and facilitate communication. In observing how visualization is used in presentations and discussions, I often notice the use of what could be called ""visual anecdotes."" Small narratives are tied to individual data points in the visualization, giving human context to the data and rooting the abstract representation in personal experience. This paper argues that these narratives are more than just illustrations of the dataset; they constitute a central epistemological element of the visualization. By considering these narrative elements as parts of the visualization, its design and knowledge organization appear in a different light. This paper investigates how the ""story"" of data representation is delivered.

The authors used an instrument called the Assessment of Art Attributes to examine the work of two individuals with left-brain damage and one with right-hemisphere damage. In each case, their art became more abstract and distorted and less realistic. They also painted with looser strokes, less depth and more vibrant colors. No unique pattern was observed following right-brain damage. However, art produced after left-brain damage also became more symbolic.

Such art helps to stimulate complex psychological events—beyond the perceptual responses usually studied by neuroscience. If science is to engage meaningfully with art, scientists need to address the conceptual content of our experience of many different kinds of art. As a test case, this essay suggests that neuroaesthetics should come to terms with works such as Marcel Duchamp's Bôite-envalise (1935-1941), which is representative of many artworks and art exhibitions organized into composite parts or groups of works. The essay shows that, typically, art stimulates a network of conceptual relations rather than merely perceptions of the visible aspects of single artworks."

How is public space as physical construct changing with new embedded forms of computing? How is a public formed? What new material sensibilities emerge? And what role does their essentially fleeting or transitional character play?"

The instrumental design of the soundsphere has focused on three types of shells: hard, static, and inflexible; physically manipulable; and immaterial (or electroacoustic). This frames a disciplinary and historical context for Resonant Chamber, a prototype-based design research project that develops a kinetic and interactive interior envelope system aimed at transforming the acoustic environment through dynamic spatial, material, and electroacoustic technologies."

It discusses and analyzes experiments that use an advanced LED cube to create immersive, interactive installations and environments where visitors and visuals share a common physical space. As a visual medium, the LED cube has very specific properties and affordances, and optimizing the potential for such systems to create meaningful experiences presents many interlinked challenges. Two artworks exploring these possibilities are discussed. Both have been exhibited internationally in a variety of settings. Together with this paper, the works shed some light on the design considerations and experiential possibilities afforded by LED cubes and arrays. They also suggest that LED grids have potential as an emerging medium for immersive volumetric visualizations that occupy physical space."

The authors present their artistic, scientific and engineering work on a robotic installation, the Articulated Head, and its perception-action control system, the Thinking Head Attention Model and Behavioral System (THAMBS). The authors propose that agency emerges from the interplay of the robots behavior and the environment and that, in the system's interaction with humans, it is to the same degree attributed to the robot as it is grounded in the robot's actions: Agency cannot be instilled; it needs to be evoked."

The authors approach the topic under the umbrella of media archaeology and aim to extend this historiographically oriented field of media theory into a methodology for contemporary artistic practice. Hence, media archaeology becomes not only a method for excavation of repressed and forgotten media discourses, but extends itself into an artistic method close to Do-It-Yourself (DIY) culture, circuit bending, hardware hacking and other hacktivist exercises that are closely related to the political economy of information technology. The concept of dead media is discussed as ""zombie media""—dead media revitalized, brought back to use, reworked."
